In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine  5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone  0.2 to 2 mg/kg.
The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone 
In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine  10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone  10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM).
Lidocaine induced cardiac_asystole 
Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67-year-old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers.
Suxamethonium infusion rate and observed fasciculations 
The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded.
Galanthamine_hydrobromide  an anticholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier, was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of scopolamine (hyoscine  overdosage 
Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium induced chronic_renal_failure in rats.
Rats with lithium induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal_failure 
Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis 
HP failed to accentuante progression of renal_failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats.
The results indicate that Li induced nephropathy  even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension 
Treatment of Crohn's_disease with fusidic_acid  an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin 
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn's_disease  a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic_acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients.
The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic_acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn's_disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective.
Electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial_injury in psychiatrically hospitalized cocaine abusers.
The electrocardiograms (ECG) of 99 cocaine abusing patients were compared with the ECGs of 50 schizophrenic controls.
Sulpiride induced tardive_dystonia 
Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects, sulpiride induced tardive_dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occasionally.
We studied a 37-year-old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therapy.
Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine 
During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual_toxicity  6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity.
Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of hearing_loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3.
This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels.
Myasthenia_gravis presenting as weakness after magnesium administration.
We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular_disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia 
Although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia_gravis  it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease.
Based on clinical data, indicating that chloroacetaldehyde (CAA  is an important metabolite of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics, an experimental study was carried out in order to elucidate the role of CAA in the development of hemorrhagic cystitis 
The data demonstrate that CAA after i.v. administration does not contribute to bladder_damage 
Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study.
Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group.
Subsequently 20 migraine patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin  received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas.
Thus the migraine inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain  suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis.
Clotiazepam induced acute hepatitis 
We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive_hepatocellular_necrosis  7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam  a thienodiazepine derivative.
The administration of several benzodiazepines  chemically related to clotiazepam  did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis 
Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment.
Two of 14 patients with Cushing's_syndrome treated on a long-term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension 
In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment.
Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (Captopril  on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular_coagulation in the rat.
Induction of intravascular_coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic_acid (AMCA  in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man.
Injection of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model.
Renal_damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril 
A randomized comparison of labetalol and nitroprusside for induced hypotension 
In a randomized study, labetalol induced hypotension and nitroprusside induced hypotension were compared in 20 patients (10 in each group) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures.
Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) increase_in_heart_rate_and_cardiac_output  rebound hypertension was observed in three patients after discontinuation of nitroprusside 
Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat: efficacy, toxicity  and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations.
In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene_glycol  by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight_gain 
Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl_ether (HFDE  were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES).
Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against HFDE induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight_gain over 8 weeks of treatment.
Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin 
Impotence was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co-morbidity and the taking of methotrexate 
Does paracetamol cause urothelial_cancer or renal_papillary_necrosis 
The risk of developing renal_papillary_necrosis or cancer_of_the_renal_pelvis,_ureter_or_bladder associated with consumption of either phenacetin or paracetamol was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls.
The risk of renal_papillary_necrosis was increased nearly 20-fold by consumption of phenacetin  which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder but not for ureteric_cancer 
Dapsone associated Heinz body hemolytic_anemia in a Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait.
A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait (AE) and leprosy developed a Heinz body hemolytic_anemia while taking a dose of dapsone (50 mg/day) not usually associated with clinical hemolysis 
Thus, AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo, since dapsone does not cause hemolytic_anemia at this dose in hematologically normal individuals.
Triazolam induced brief episodes of secondary mania in a depressed patient.
Large doses of triazolam repeatedly induced brief episodes of mania in a depressed elderly woman.
Manic excitement was coincident with the duration of action of triazolam 
On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular_rigidity produced by morphine in rats.
The development of tolerance to the muscular_rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats.
Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram.
Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group).
In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference.
Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group.
The results suggest that rigidity  which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum.
Compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to pentazocine induced fibrous_myopathy 
Fibrous_myopathy is a common, well-known side effect of repeated pentazocine injection.
However, compression_neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pentazocine induced myopathy has not previously been reported.
Recurrent reversible acute_renal_failure from amphotericin 
A patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis and disseminated sporotrichosis developed acute_renal_failure immediately following the administration of amphotericin_B on four separate occasions.
Pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therapy.
A patient with sinuatrial_disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone (maximum dose 1000 mg, maintenance dose 800 mg daily) for 10 months, for control of supraventricular_tachyarrhythmias 
Indomethacin induced renal_insufficiency  recurrence on rechallenge.
We have reported a case of acute oliguric renal_failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis  ascites  and cor_pulmonale after indomethacin therapy.
Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal, while re-exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria 
Changes in heart size during long-term timolol treatment after myocardial_infarction 
The effect of long-term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial_infarction was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, timolol 115).
These differences may be caused by timolol induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume.
Vitamin_D3 toxicity in dairy cows.
Large parenteral doses of vitamin_D3 (15 to 17.5 x 10(6) IU vitamin_D3  were associated with prolonged hypercalcemia  hyperphosphatemia  and large increases of vitamin_D3 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows.
None of the cows treated with vitamin_D3 showed signs of milk_fever during the peripartal period; however, 22% of the control cows developed clinical signs of milk_fever during this period.
Signs of vitamin_D3 toxicity were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows; however, pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of vitamin_D3 toxicity and 10 of 17 cows died.
Peripheral_neuropathy due to nutritional_deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-motor_neuropathy 
Isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug induced neuropathy 
A double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of dothiepin_hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive_disorder 
In a 6-week double-blind parallel treatment study, dothiepin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed outpatients.
Dothiepin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive_illness  and both were significantly superior to placebo.
The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blurred_vision  dry_mouth  and drowsiness were significantly less with dothiepin than with amitriptyline 
Behavioral effects of diazepam and propranolol in patients with panic_disorder and agoraphobia 
The effects of oral doses of diazepam (single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks) and propranolol (single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg/day for 2 weeks) on psychological performance of patients with panic_disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in a double-blind, randomized and crossover design.
Both drugs impaired_immediate_free_recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol 
The co-administration of aspirin with N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide (FANFT  to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT induced bladder_carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach_tumors 
The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach, and that aspirin s effect on FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation.
Provocation of postural hypotension by nitroglycerin in diabetic_autonomic_neuropathy 
The effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects, 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic_neuropathy  and 5 diabetic subjects with autonomic_neuropathy 
The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic_neuropathy  whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic_neuropathy 
Characterization of estrogen induced adenohypophyseal_tumors in the Fischer 344 rat.

The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system.
Age-dependent sensitivity of the rat to neurotoxic effects of streptomycin 
Crescentic fibrillary glomerulonephritis associated with intermittent rifampin therapy for pulmonary_tuberculosis 
This case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative crescentic glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin who had no other identifiable causes for developing this disease.
This patient underwent a 10-month regimen of rifampin and isoniazid for pulmonary_tuberculosis and was discovered to have developed signs of severe renal_failure five weeks after completion of therapy.
Time course of lipid peroxidation in puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephropathy 
Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin_aminonucleoside (PAN  induced nephropathy  with antioxidants significantly reducing the proteinuria 
Clomipramine induced sleep_disturbance does not impair its prolactin-releasing action.
The present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep_disturbance  induced by clomipramine administration, on the secretory rate of prolactin (PRL) in addition to the direct drug effect.
Angioedema following the intravenous administration of metoprolol 
A history of angioedema secondary to lisinopril therapy was elicited.
During the first day of hospitalization (while intubated), intravenous metoprolol was given, resulting in severe angioedema 
However, coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits.
The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive_flexion_or_extension_of_one_or_more_toes 
No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group; however, extensive cranial_hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate-treated chicks.
Epidural blood flow during prostaglandin_E1 or trimethaphan induced hypotension 
To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin_E1 (PGE1  or trimethaphan (TMP  induced hypotension on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia.
After starting PGE1 or TMP  MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation.

Increase of Parkinson_disability after fluoxetine medication.
We report the increased amount of motor_disability in four patients with idiopathic_Parkinson's_disease after exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine 
Acetaminophen induced hypotension 
The potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular_toxicities is very low.
However, acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis  including hypotension  in sensitive individuals.
This article describes two critically_ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acetaminophen 
Acute hepatitis  autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia  and erythroblastocytopenia induced by ceftriaxone 
An 80-yr-old man developed acute hepatitis shortly after ingesting oral ceftriaxone 
Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the beta_lactam antibiotic, there was a gradual increase in serum bilirubin and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia and erythroblastocytopenia 
Effects of tetrandrine and fangchinoline on experimental thrombosis in mice and human platelet_aggregation 
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of TET and FAN on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine (EP  in mice, and platelet_aggregation and blood_coagulation in vitro.
In the in vivo study, the administration (50 mg/kg, i.p.) of TET and FAN in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55% and 35%, respectively, while acetylsalicylic_acid (ASA  50 mg/kg, i.p.), a positive control, showed only 30% inhibition.
In the vitro human platelet_aggregations induced by the agonists used in tests, TET and FAN showed the inhibitions dose dependently.
Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine in nonsmall_cell_lung_carcinoma patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive cisplatin 
Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB  or gemcitabine (GEM  may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life.
In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed.
METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin 
Warfarin induced artery_calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin_D 
The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin_D treatment enhance the extent of artery_calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall.
The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery_calcification in Warfarin treated rats.
Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification_of_the_artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats.
In contrast, no artery_calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment.
To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin induced artery_calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth.
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification_of_the_artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery_calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group.
Although the explanation for the association between artery_calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery_calcification  with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin induced artery_calcification  ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats.
This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin induced artery_calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels.
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin_D and Warfarin in artery_calcification 
High doses of vitamin_D are known to cause calcification_of_the_artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days.
High doses of the vitamin_K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification_of_the_artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week.
In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin_D treated rats at 3 and 4 days.
There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin_D dose on artery_calcification and the effect of vitamin_D dose on the elevation of serum calcium  which suggests that vitamin_D may induce artery_calcification through its effect on serum calcium 
Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin_D  the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin_D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor.
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery_calcification in rats treated with vitamin_D plus Warfarin  and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated 
Antidepressant induced mania in bipolar patients: identification of risk factors.
BACKGROUND: Concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar_depression 
Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age, sex, diagnosis (DSM-IV_bipolar_I vs. bipolar_II , number of previous manic episodes, type of antidepressant therapy used (electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and, more particularly, selective serotonin_reuptake_inhibitors [SSRIs ), use and type of mood stabilizers (lithium vs. anticonvulsants), and temperament of the patient, assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi-structured Affective Temperament Interview.
RESULTS: Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27% of all patients (N = 12) (and in 24% of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [8/33]); 16% (N = 7) experienced manic episodes, and 11% (N = 5) experienced hypomanic episodes.

Combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic AIDS mice.
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (CM  and in elevated plasma lactate (LA  in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial_dysfunction 
To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine  lamivudine  and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days.
At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA 
Oral_contraceptives and the risk of myocardial_infarction 
BACKGROUND: An association between the use of oral_contraceptives and the risk of myocardial_infarction has been found in some, but not all, studies.
We investigated this association, according to the type of progestagen included in third-generation (i.e., desogestrel or gestodene  and second-generation (i.e., levonorgestrel  oral_contraceptives  the dose of estrogen  and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS: In a nationwide, population-based, case-control study, we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial_infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial_infarction and who were matched for age, calendar year of the index event, and area of residence.
An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS: The odds ratio for myocardial_infarction among women who used any type of combined oral_contraceptive  as compared with nonusers, was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.8).
Among women who used oral_contraceptives  the odds ratio was 2.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.0) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 5.5) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS: The risk of myocardial_infarction was increased among women who used second-generation oral_contraceptives 
Effects of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the cocaine induced locomotor_hyperactivity in rats.
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens (the shell and the core) on the locomotor_hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats.
GR_55562 (0.1-10 microg/side), administered intra-accumbens shell prior to cocaine  dose-dependently attenuated the psychostimulant induced locomotor_hyperactivity 
Ticlopidine induced cholestatic hepatitis 
OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases of ticlopidine induced cholestatic hepatitis  investigate its mechanism, and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases.
CASE SUMMARIES: Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty, with complete remission during the follow-up period.
DISCUSSION: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine  several cases have been reported but few in the English literature.
Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis  which resolved after discontinuation of the drug.
The mechanisms of this ticlopidine induced cholestasis are unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ticlopidine that may be immune mediated.
Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephrotic_syndrome 
In experimental nephrotic_syndrome  urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease.
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin_aminonucleoside (PAN  induced nephrotic_syndrome 
The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle.
The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously.
NO induced migraine attack: strong increase in plasma calcitonin_gene-related_peptide (CGRP  concentration and negative correlation with platelet serotonin release.
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin_gene-related_peptide (CGRP  concentration and platelet serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine  5-HT  content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin 
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times: 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application, and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack (mean 344 and 404 min; 12 subjects).
Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly (P<0.01) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine 
However, plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack.
Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack.
Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly (P<0.01) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack.
In conclusion, the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine 
Coronary_aneurysm after implantation of a paclitaxel eluting stent.
We present a 43-year-old man who developed a coronary_aneurysm in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a paclitaxel eluting stent.
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of U-II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion.
Whatever was the dose, the central administration of U-II had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine induced penile_erection and climbing behavior, and stress induced plasma corticosterone level.
Recurrent dysphonia and acitretin 
We report the case of a woman complaining of dysphonia while she was treated by acitretin 
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin  a drug effective in neuropathic_pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states.
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin induced secondary_hyperalgesia 
MDMA polydrug users show process-specific central executive impairments coupled with impaired_social_and_emotional_judgement_processes 
In recent years working memory_deficits have been reported in users of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  ecstasy .
Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation.
We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection.
Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium_gluconate was initiated, and muscle_contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes.
The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium_citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia 
Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop_diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia 
We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity 
Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients.
More recently, proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear.
We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion.
The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy, due to chronic_allograft_nephropathy (CAN  (n = 15) neoplasia (n = 8); Kaposi's_sarcoma  Four skin_cancers  One intestinal_tumors  One renal_cell_carsinom  or BK virus nephropathy (n = 2).
Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation.

Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts thrombosis in patients with heparin induced thrombocytopenia 
OBJECTIVES: To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two-step heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT  antigen assay with thrombosis  the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics of a high heparin concentration.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with more than 50% decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia (<150 x 10(9)/L) after exposure to heparin  who had a positive two-step antigen assay [optical density (OD) >0.4 and >50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin  were included in the study.
Central retinal_vein_occlusion associated with clomiphene induced ovulation.
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of central retinal_vein_occlusion associated with clomiphene_citrate (CC .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Central retinal_vein_occlusion after ovulation induction with CC 
RESULT(S): A 36-year-old Chinese woman developed central retinal_vein_occlusion after eight courses of CC 
A search of the literature on the thromboembolic complications of CC does not include this severe ophthalmic complication, although mild visual_disturbance after CC intake is not uncommon.
CONCLUSION(S): This is the first reported case of central retinal_vein_occlusion after treatment with CC 
Nicotine induced nystagmus correlates with midpontine activation.
The pathomechanism of nicotine induced nystagmus (NIN  is unknown.
NIN correlated with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis.
Protective effect of verapamil on gastric_hemorrhagic ulcers in severe atherosclerotic rats.
The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back-diffusion, mast cell histamine release, lipid peroxide (LPO) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating gastric_hemorrhage and ulcer in rats with atherosclerosis induced by coadministration of vitamin_D2 and cholesterol 
Additionally, the protective effect of verapamil on this ulcer model was evaluated.
Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1.0 ml/kg of corn oil containing vitamin_D2 and cholesterol to induce atherosclerosis 
Gastric acid back-diffusion, mucosal LPO generation, histamine concentration, microvascular permeability, luminal hemoglobin content and ulcer areas were determined.
Elevated atherosclerotic parameters, such as serum calcium  total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in atherosclerotic rats.
Severe gastric ulcers accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors, including gastric acid back-diffusion, histamine release, LPO generation and luminal hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats.
Moreover, a positive correlation of histamine to gastric_hemorrhage and to ulcer was found in those atherosclerotic rats.
This hemorrhagic ulcer and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose-dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric verapamil 
Adriamycin induced autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of heart_failure 
BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying heart_failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart_failure induced by adriamycin  so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart_failure 
METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA , a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart_failure model of rats induced by adriamycin 
CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart_failure in rats induced by adriamycin 
Confusion  a rather serious adverse drug reaction with valproic_acid  a review of the French Pharmacovigilance database.
INTRODUCTION: Confusion is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with valproic_acid 
METHODS: Using the French Pharmacovigilance database, we selected the cases of confusion reported since 1985 with valproic_acid 
RESULTS: 272 cases of confusion were reported with valproic_acid  153 women and 119 men.
Confusion mostly occurred during the two first weeks following valproic_acid exposure (39.7%).
Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task.
It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance.
Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users.
A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions.
Prolonged elevation of plasma argatroban in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis 
BACKGROUND: Direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT  or HIT with thrombosis (HITT  undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
In the following report, a 65-year-old critically_ill patient with a suspected history of HITT was administered argatroban for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation.
RESULTS: Unexpectedly high concentrations of argatroban were measured in these samples (range, 0-32 microg/mL), and a prolonged plasma argatroban half life (t(1/2)) of 514 minutes was observed (published elimination t(1/2) is 39-51 minutes [< or = 181 minutes with hepatic_impairment ).
CONCLUSIONS: Correlation of plasma argatroban concentration versus the patient's coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma argatroban may have contributed to the patient's extended coagulopathy 
Antituberculosis therapy induced acute_liver_failure  magnitude, profile, prognosis, and predictors of outcome.
Antituberculosis therapy (ATT)-associated acute_liver_failure (ATT-ALF  is the commonest drug induced ALF in South Asia.
In multivariate analysis, three factors independently predicted mortality: serum bilirubin (>or=10.8 mg/dL), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation (>or=26 seconds), and grade III/IV encephalopathy at presentation.
CNS complications included posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (n = 10), stroke (n = 5), temporal_lobe_epilepsy (n = 2), high-dose methotrexate toxicity (n = 2), syndrome of inappropriate_antidiuretic_hormone_secretion (n = 1), and other unclassified events (n = 7).
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Fluoropyrimidines  in particular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU , have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid tumors  including colorectal,_breast_and_head_and_neck_cancers  for > 40 years.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain better insight into the safety of capecitabine in special populations such as patients with advanced age, renal_and_kidney_disease

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol induced parkinsonian_symptoms 
RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol induced parkinsonian_catalepsy in rats.
Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during nitroprusside induced hypotension 
Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease_in_arterial_blood_pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased_cardiac_output and QS/QT.
Nitroprusside caused significant decreases_in_arterial_blood_pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT.
Mediation of enhanced reflex vagal bradycardia by L-dopa via central dopamine formation in dogs.
In addition, reflex bradycardia caused by injected norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by L-dopa  DL-Threo-dihydroxyphenylserine had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or reflex responses to norepinephrine 
FLA-63  a dopamine beta-oxidase inhibitor, did not have any effect on the hypotension  bradycardia or reflex-enhancing effect of L-dopa 
However, L-dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate. 5-HTP (5 mg/kg i.v.) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to norepinephrine 
It is concluded that L-dopa enhances reflex bradycardia through central alpha-receptor stimulation.
Cocaine induced myocardial_infarction  clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations.
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute_myocardial_infarction 
In individuals with preexisting, high-grade coronary arterial narrowing, acute_myocardial_infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine induced increase in rate-pressure product.
With regard to spasm  the clinical findings are largely circumstantial, and the locus of cocaine induced vasoconstriction remains speculative.
Rabbit_syndrome  antidepressant use, and cerebral perfusion SPECT scan findings.
Acute bronchodilating effects of ipratropium_bromide and theophylline in chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease 
The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium_bromide aerosol (36 micrograms) and short-acting theophylline tablets (dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10-20 micrograms/mL) were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease 
While side effects were rare, those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems.
Renal_papillary_necrosis (RPN  and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats.
Effect of adriamycin combined with whole body hyperthermia on tumor and normal tissues.
Thermal enhancement of Adriamycin mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared using a F344 rat model.
Whole body hyperthermia (120 min at 41.5 degrees C) enhanced both Adriamycin mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects.
Prazosin induced stress_incontinence 
A case of genuine stress_incontinence due to prazosin  a common antihypertensive drug, is presented.
Myocardial_infarction following sublingual administration of isosorbide_dinitrate 
A 78-year-old with healed septal necrosis suffered a recurrent myocardial_infarction of the anterior wall following the administration of isosorbide_dinitrate 5 mg sublingually.
Fluoxetine induced akathisia  clinical and theoretical implications.
Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive_compulsive_disorder or major_depression developed akathisia 
The typical fluoxetine induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic induced akathisia 
Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder.
Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol  dose reduction, or both.
Chronic_active_hepatitis associated with diclofenac_sodium therapy.
Although generally well-tolerated, asymptomatic abnormalities_of_liver_function have been recorded and, less commonly, severe hepatitis induced by diclofenac 
Stroke associated with cocaine use.
We describe eight patients in whom cocaine use was related to stroke and review 39 cases from the literature.
Stroke followed cocaine use by inhalation, intranasal, intravenous, and intramuscular routes.
These data indicate that (1) the apparent incidence of stroke related to cocaine use is increasing.
(2) cocaine associated stroke occurs primarily in young adults.
(3) stroke may follow any route of cocaine administration.
Glyburide induced hepatitis 
Drug induced hepatotoxicity  although common, has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas 
For glyburide  a second-generation sulfonylurea  only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist.
Two patients with type_II_diabetes_mellitus developed an acute_hepatitis-like_syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy.
Systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium_nitroprusside induced hypotension in ventilated dogs.
Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM  n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium_nitroprusside (SNP  n = 7).
During HEM induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group.
The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02).
The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02).
Drug induced arterial spasm relieved by lidocaine 
Following major intracranial surgery in a 35-year-old man, sodium_pentothal was intravenously infused to minimize cerebral_ischaemia 
Cerebral blood flow and metabolism during isoflurane induced hypotension in patients subjected to surgery for cerebral_aneurysms 
Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral_aneurysm 
Flow and metabolism were measured 5-13 days after the subarachnoid_haemorrhage by a modification of the classical Kety-Schmidt technique using xenon 133 i.v.
Controlled hypotension to an average MAP of 50-55 mm Hg was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane  and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%.
After the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.75%.
Allergic_reaction to 5-fluorouracil infusion.
An allergic_reaction consisting of angioneurotic_edema secondary to continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil occurred in a patient with recurrent carcinoma_of_the_oral_cavity  cirrhosis  and cisplatin induced impaired_renal_function 
Amiodarone induced sinoatrial_block 
We observed sinoatrial_block due to chronic amiodarone administration in a 5-year-old boy with primary_cardiomyopathy  Wolff-Parkinson-White_syndrome and supraventricular_tachycardia 
Three infants, born of two mothers with inflammatory_bowel_disease who received treatment with sulphasalazine throughout pregnancy, were found to have major congenital_anomalies 
Veno-occlusive_liver_disease after dacarbazine therapy (DTIC  for melanoma

A case of tardive_dyskinesia caused by metoclopramide 
Abnormal_involuntary_movements appeared in the mouth, tongue, neck and abdomen of a 64-year-old male patient after he took metoclopramide for gastrointestinal_disorder in a regimen of 30 mg per day for a total of about 260 days.
When the metoclopramide administration was discontinued, the abnormal_movements gradually improved to a considerable extent.
A case is presented of a reversible intra-Hisian_block occurring under amiodarone treatment for atrial_tachycardia in a patient without clear intraventricular_conduction_abnormalities 
Thirty days after amiodarone discontinuation, His bundle electrograms showed atrial_flutter without intra-Hisian or infra-Hisian delay.
Busulfan induced hemorrhagic cystitis 
A case of a busulfan induced hemorrhage cystitis is reported.
The similarity between the histologic appearances of busulfan cystitis and both radiation and cyclophosphamide induced cystitis is discussed and the world literature reviewed.
Rebound hypertensive after sodium_nitroprusside prevented by saralasin in rats.
The role of the renin--angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium_nitroprusside (SNP  induced hypotension was evaluated.
During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase_in_blood_pressure to 61 torr, whereas the saralasin treated animals showed no change.
Toxic_hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs: four cases including one with cross-reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil 
Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (N__omercazole .
Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole 
One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basd__ne  had replaced carbimazole 
Study of the role of vitamin_B12 and folinic_acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of zidovudine 
A prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin_B12 and folinic_acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine (ZDV  induced bone_marrow_suppression 
Seventy-five human_immunodeficiency_virus_(HIV)-infected patients with CD4+ cell counts < 500/mm3 were randomized to receive either ZDV (500 mg daily) alone (group I, n = 38) or in combination with folinic_acid (15 mg daily) and intramascular vitamin_B12 (1000 micrograms monthly) (group II, n = 37).
There was no correlation between vitamin_B12 or folate levels and development of myelosuppression 
Acute confusion induced by a high-dose infusion of 5-fluorouracil and folinic_acid 
A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum  etoposide  high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic_acid for an inoperable gastric_adenocarcinoma 
He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion  disorientation and irritability  and then lapsed into a deep coma  lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic_acid infusion.
Because folinic_acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected.
The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate  thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency.
Carbamazepine was switched to its 10-keto analogue oxcarbazepine among six difficult-to-treat schizophrenic or organic_psychotic patients using concomitantly haloperidol  chlorpromazine or clozapine 
Erythema_multiforme and hypersensitivity_myocarditis caused by ampicillin 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of erythema_multiforme and hypersensitivity_myocarditis caused by ampicillin 
CASE SUMMARY: A 13-year-old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia 
Immediate allergic_reactions to amoxicillin 
A large group of patients with suspected allergic_reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics was evaluated.
A detailed clinical history, together with skin tests, RAST (radioallergosorbent test), and controlled challenge tests, was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin (AX  or were cross-reacting with other penicillin derivatives.
A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics.
We selected the 54 (30.5%) cases of immediate AX allergy with good tolerance of PG 
All the patients were skin test negative to BPO  49 of 51 (96%) were also negative to MDM  and 44 of 46 (96%) to PG 
Challenge tests with AX were performed in 23 subjects (43%) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic_reaction to AX  and in 15 cases (28%) both skin test and RAST for AX were negative.
We describe the largest group of AX allergic patients who have tolerated PG reported so far.
Persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids.
Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as vecuronium_bromide  especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids.
Atracurium_besylate  a short-acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent paralysis  but only when used with corticosteroids.
Habitual use of acetaminophen as a risk factor for chronic_renal_failure  a comparison with phenacetin 
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of phenacetin is associated with the development of chronic_renal_failure and end-stage_renal_disease (ESRD , with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19.
However, three case control studies, one each in North Carolina, northern Maryland, and West Berlin, Germany, showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic_renal_failure and ESRD  with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4.
These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD  with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former.
Reduction of heparan_sulphate associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin induced diabetic_nephropathy 
Heparan_sulphate associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye cuprolinic_blue 
The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen (NG , methotrexate (MTX , 5-fluorouracil (5-FU  and cyclophosphamide (CY  administered alone or in combination [MTX + 5-FU + CY (CMF)] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats.
CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5-FU and MTX 
Lithium associated cognitive_and_functional_deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex_sodium  a case series.
BACKGROUND: Lithium remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar_disorder 
Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium  such as polyuria and tremor  more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive_deficits  loss_of_creativity  and functional_impairments remain understudied.
This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex_sodium to alleviate such cognitive_and_functional_impairments 
RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium  either fully or partially, with divalproex_sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive,_motivational,_or_creative_deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients.
Treatment of previously treated metastatic breast_cancer by mitoxantrone and 48-hour continuous infusion of high-dose 5-FU and leucovorin (MFL : low palliative benefit and high treatment-related toxicity 
From October 1993 to November 1995, we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy-treated metastatic breast_cancer by mitoxantrone  12 mg/m2, on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5-FU  3000 mg/m2, together with leucovorin  300 mg/m2, for 48 h from day 1 to 2.
The MFL_regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rate.
Upregulation of the expression of vasopressin gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the lithium induced diabetes_insipidus rat.
The expression of arginine_vasopressin (AVP  gene in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) was investigated in rats with lithium (Li  induced polyuria  using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay.
The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained LiCl (60 mmol/kg) for 4 weeks developed marked polyuria 
Suxamethonium induced cardiac_arrest and death following 5 days of immobilization.
The present report describes a case of cardiac_arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyperkalaemia following the use of suxamethonium in a 23-year-old Malawian woman.
Forty seconds after injection of suxamethonium  bradycardia and cardiac_arrest occurred.
Apart from the reduction in the patient's level of consciousness, there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyperkalaemia following the administration of suxamethonium 
An increase_in_blood_pressure  accompanied by atrial_fibrillation  agitation  incomprehensible_shouts and loss_of_consciousness  was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's_contracture 
RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA_nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11).
Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy  respectively.
Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial_fibrosis (11 biopsies).
The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group (P< 0.001).
In the mouse passive-avoidance test, PG-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1-selective antagonist S-(-)-ET-126 
In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine induced amnesia  demonstrating a central localization of the activity.
Angioedema due to ACE_inhibitors  common and inadequately diagnosed.
Recurrent use of newer oral_contraceptives and the risk of venous_thromboembolism 
The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous_thromboembolism (VTE  associated with newer oral_contraceptives (OC  did not distinguish between patterns of OC use, namely first-time users, repeaters and switchers.
The adjusted rate ratio of VTE for repeat users of third generation OC was 0.6 (95% CI:0.3-1.2) relative to repeat users of second generation pills, whereas it was 1.3 (95% CI:0.7-2.4) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills.
Development of apomorphine induced aggressive_behavior  comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats.
The development of apomorphine induced (1.0 mg/kg s.c. once daily) aggressive_behavior of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets.
In male animals, repeated apomorphine treatment induced a gradual development of aggressive_behavior as evidenced by the increased intensity of aggressiveness and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent.
Serotonergic_antidepressants and urinary_incontinence 
This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine 
In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline  as well as a third who developed this side effect on venlafaxine 
In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking lithium_carbonate and beta-blockers, both of which could have contributed to the incontinence 
Hypotension following the initiation of tizanidine in a patient treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic hypertension 
Adults chronically treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to hypotension when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked.
The authors present a 10-year-old boy chronically treated with lisinopril  an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, to control hypertension who developed hypotension following the addition of tizanidine  an alpha-2 agonist, for the treatment of spasticity 
These 13 included cases of malignant_hypertension  thrombotic_microangiopathy  lupus_nephritis  Henoch-Schonlein_nephritis  crescentic glomerulonephritis  and cocaine related acute_renal_failure 
In behavioral studies, pre-treatment of mice with BD1018  BD1063  or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine induced convulsions and lethality.
In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists, the well-characterized sigma receptor agonist di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG  and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 (3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane  each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine 
To further validate the hypothesis that the anti-cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine 
TDP is a side-effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market (e.g. terfenadine and terodiline . 2.
Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated: terfenadine  terodiline  cisapride and E4031 
For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic (terfenadine  terodiline  cisapride  there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man (< 10-fold) reflecting their limited safety margins.
Fatal myeloencephalopathy due to accidental intrathecal vincristin administration: a report of two cases.
We report on two fatal cases of accidental intrathecal vincristine instillation in a 5-year old girl with recurrent acute_lymphoblastic_leucemia and a 57-year old man with lymphoblastic_lymphoma 
Histological and immunohistochemical investigations (HE-LFB, CD-68, Neurofilament) revealed degeneration of myelin and axons as well as pseudocystic_transformation in areas exposed to vincristine  accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages.
Intravenous administration of prochlorperazine by 15-minute infusion versus 2-minute bolus does not affect the incidence of akathisia  a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
STUDY OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the rate of akathisia after administration of intravenous prochlorperazine as a 2-minute bolus or 15-minute infusion.
Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache  nausea  or vomiting were eligible for inclusion.
CONCLUSION: A 50% reduction in the incidence of akathisia when prochlorperazine was administered by means of 15-minute intravenous infusion versus a 2-minute intravenous push was not detected.
Antithymocyte_globulin in the treatment of D-penicillamine induced aplastic_anemia 
A patient who received antithymocyte_globulin therapy for aplastic_anemia due to D-penicillamine therapy is described.
The relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure prone and withdrawal seizure resistant selected mouse lines.
METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol na  ve Withdrawal Seizure Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice.
Animals were administered nicotine  carbachol  or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose.
Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling induced convulsions 
RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine  carbachol  and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice.
When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling induced convulsions  extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal.
Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal_injury in the rat.
The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase_in_blood_pressure and renal_injury in rats.
Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction_in_glomerular_number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age.
Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated_blood_pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction_in_glomerular_number 
Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats.
This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction_in_glomerular_number  glomerulosclerosis  and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation.
The risk of venous_thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone_acetate in combination with ethinyl_estradiol  a nested cohort analysis and case-control study.
BACKGROUND: Cyproterone_acetate combined with ethinyl_estradiol (CPA EE  is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic_ovary_syndrome (PCOS .
Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous_thromboembolism (VTE  associated with CPA EE compared with conventional combined oral_contraceptives (COCs).
METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne  hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA EE 
Pseudoacromegaly induced by the long-term use of minoxidil 
We present a patient with pseudoacromegaly that resulted from the long-term use of minoxidil at an unusually high dose.
All patients received CAB [leuprolide_acetate (LHRH-A  3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide  tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB).
Reversible dilated_cardiomyopathy related to amphotericin_B therapy.
We describe a patient who developed dilated_cardiomyopathy and clinical congestive heart_failure after 2 months of therapy with amphotericin_B (AmB  for disseminated coccidioidomycosis 
His echocardiographic abnormalities and heart_failure resolved after posaconazole was substituted for AmB 
Although the United States Food and Drug Administration banned its use for nocturnal_leg_cramps due to lack of safety and efficacy, quinine is widely available in beverages including tonic water and bitter lemon.
Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing quinine may produce neurological_complications  including confusion  altered mental status, seizures  and coma  particularly in older women.
Organophosphate induced convulsions and prevention of neuropathological_damages 
The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh  levels.
The rats treated with DFP atropine showed severe typical OP induced toxicity signs.
When CPA  diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP atropine  these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning 
Atropine MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity 
Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-imidazoline receptor-mediated hypotension in female rats.
We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine (mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction.
In sham-operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha-methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure.
Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha-methyldopa  in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension 
The enhanced alpha-methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a_reduced_locomotor_activity 
Cardioprotective effect of tincture_of_Crataegus on isoproterenol induced myocardial_infarction in rats.
The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial_infarction in rats.
METHODS: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolled 7,705 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, raloxifene was associated with an increased risk for venous_thromboembolism (relative risk [RR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.8).
Raloxifene did not increase risk for cataracts (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.8-1.1), gallbladder_disease (RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.7-1.3), endometrial_hyperplasia (RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.4-5.1), or endometrial_cancer (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-2.7).
Ceftriaxone associated biliary_pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients.
It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients.
In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period.
Evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody GNC92H2 as an immunotherapy for cocaine_overdose 
The illicit use of cocaine continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for cocaine_overdose remains elusive.
The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody GNC92H2 was examined using a model of cocaine_overdose 
Significant blockade of cocaine toxicity was observed with the higher dose of GNC92H2 (190 mg/kg), where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40%, seizures up to 77% and death by 72%.
Importantly, GNC92H2 prevented death even post-cocaine injection.
Ketoconazole induced torsades_de_pointes without concomitant use of QT interval-prolonging drug.
We report a woman with coronary_artery_disease who developed a markedly prolonged_QT_interval and torsades_de_pointes (TdP  after taking ketoconazole for treatment of fungal_infection 
We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr, ketoconazole alone may prolong QT interval and induce TdP 
Diazepam , scopolamine  and ageing induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models.
Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.).
Cauda_equina_syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report.
OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy.
The following case is a report of cauda_equina_syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine 
CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection.
High-dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen testosterone therapy (estradiol-_and_testosterone_esters  and aortic atherosclerosis 
The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes  cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol use.
Sirolimus associated proteinuria and renal_dysfunction 
Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy 
Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'.
However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute_renal_dysfunction 
The mechanisms of sirolimus associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal.
The acute_renal_dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes.
Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin_II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed.
Progressive myopathy with up-regulation of MHC-I associated with statin therapy.
Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug.
What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy  which persists or may progress after stopping the drug.
These observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune-mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy.
Clonidine induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice.

Neuroinflammation and behavioral_abnormalities after neonatal terbutaline treatment in rats: implications for autism 
Terbutaline  a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm_labor  has been associated with increased concordance for autism in dizygotic twins.
Acute myocarditis associated with clozapine 
OBJECTIVE: A case of acute myocarditis associated with the commencement of clozapine is described, highlighting the onset, course and possible contributing factors.
RESULTS: A 20-year-old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of clozapine 
CONCLUSIONS: Myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of clozapine 
Considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis  there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients.
Encephalopathy induced by levetiracetam added to valproate 
BACKGROUND: We report on the manifestation of a levetiracetam (LEV  induced encephalopathy 
FINDINGS: A 28-year-old man suffering from idiopathic_epilepsy with generalized seizures was treated with LEV (3000 mg) added to valproate (VPA  (2000 mg).
Norepinephrine signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine induced anxiety 
While the mechanisms underlying cocaine s rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine  such as anxiety 
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE , in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine induced anxiety 
RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration.
Cocaine induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram  a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor.
In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine induced anxiety like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect.
Clonidine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity_disorder  II.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity_disorder (ADHD .
METHOD: In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30).
RESULTS: There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes.
Drowsiness was common on clonidine  but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine  used alone or with methylphenidate  appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD 
Thalidomide has limited single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin_lymphomas  a phase II trial of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B.
Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple_myeloma  mantle_cell_lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic_lymphoma 
Between July 2001 and April 2004, 24 patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphomas received thalidomide 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1-2 weeks as tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mg daily.
Intracavernous epinephrine  a minimally invasive treatment for priapism in the emergency department.

Development of ocular_myasthenia during pegylated_interferon and ribavirin treatment for chronic_hepatitis_C 
A 63-year-old male experienced sudden diplopia after 9 weeks of administration of pegylated_interferon_(IFN)_alpha-2b and ribavirin for chronic_hepatitis_C (CHC .
Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission.
However, the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  receptor produce schizophrenic like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor.
This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic-like properties of SSR103800  with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity  involving either drug challenge (ie, amphetamine and MK-801  or transgenic mice (ie, NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) and DAT(-/-)).
Results showed that SSR103800 (10-30 mg/kg p.o.) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1(neo-/-) mice.
In contrast, SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter (DAT(-/-)) knockout mice (10-30 mg/kg p.o.).
Importantly, both classical (haloperidol  and atypical (olanzapine  clozapine and aripiprazole  antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity 
However, unlike these latter, SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy (retention on the bar test) up to 30 mg/kg p.o.
Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces_frontal_lobe_oxygenation following anesthesia induced hypotension 
We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia induced hypotension 
RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral_inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory_impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding  and corticostriatal_dysfunction 
A case is reported of the hemolytic_uremic_syndrome (HUS  in a woman taking oral_contraceptives

Eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0.5%/12h, suffering from depression diagnosed through DMS-III-R criteria, were included in the study.
In a double blind cross-over study with control group, the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the Beck and the Zung-Conde scales (p < 0.001 vs control).
Long-term follow-up of ifosfamide renal_toxicity in children treated for malignant_mesenchymal_tumors  an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report.
The renal function of 74 children with malignant_mesenchymal_tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant_Mesenchymal_Tumor Study 84 [SIOP MMT 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment.
Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, glucosuria  proteinuria  aminoaciduria  urinary pH, osmolarity, creatinine clearance, phosphate tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria.
Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi's_syndrome (TDFS ; and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption.
Severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide  a younger age (less than 2 1/2 years old), and a predominance of vesicoprostatic tumor involvement.
Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine induced hyperactivity in rats.
Nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase_in_locomotor_activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment.
Nicotine induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH_23390  the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine 
Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine induced hyperactivity  whereas the D1 agonist SKF_38393 had no effect.
The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment.
Reduction in injection pain using buffered lidocaine as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization.
Previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic pH of the solution.
To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection, we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral area.
The mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine (2.7 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.8 +/- 2.2, P = 0.03).
Randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne_dystrophy 
We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol  a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne_dystrophy 
Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased_appetite (36%), dry_mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal_symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients.
Pentoxifylline (Trental  does not inhibit dipyridamole induced coronary hyperemia  implications for dipyridamole thallium 201 myocardial imaging.
Dipyridamole thallium 201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral_vascular_disease 
Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (Trental , a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent_claudication 
Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole thallium 201 imaging is unknown.
Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole induced hyperemia  while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01).
Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with Argentine_hemorrhagic_fever 
Tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with Argentine_hemorrhagic_fever (AHF  of more than 8 days of evolution.
Administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon titers.
From these results, we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of AHF  and that anemia  the only secondary reaction observed, can be easily managed.
Dipyridamole induced myocardial_ischemia 
Angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures.
To our knowledge, this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy, although dipyridamole induced myocardial_ischemia has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with coronary_artery_disease 
Nitroprusside induced hypotension evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing factor (irCRF) into the hypophysial-portal circulation.
Noradrenergic involvement in catalepsy induced by delta_9-tetrahydrocannabinol

Verapamil induced carbamazepine neurotoxicity 
Two patients with signs of carbamazepine neurotoxicity after combined treatment with verapamil showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the calcium entry blocker.
Serial studies of auditory_neurotoxicity in patients receiving deferoxamine therapy.
Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine 
Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory_abnormality  and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated.
Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine  respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity 
Flurbiprofen in the treatment of juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis 
Thirty-four patients with juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis  who were treated with flurbiprofen at a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg/day, had statistically significant decreases from baseline in 6 arthritis indices after 12 weeks of treatment.
The correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox induced neuropathic_damage in rats.
The correlation between neuropathic_damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox (N,_N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate , a neurotoxic organophosphate 
In contrast, dosages of Mipafox (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of cord_damage in only 9% of the animals.

Phenobarbitone induced enlargement_of_the_liver in the rat: its relationship to carbon_tetrachloride induced cirrhosis 
The yield of severe cirrhosis_of_the_liver (defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology, ascites greater than 30 ml, plasma albumin less than 2.2 g/dl, splenomegaly 2-3 times normal, and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight) after 12 doses of carbon_tetrachloride given intragastrically in the phenobarbitone primed rat was increased from 25% to 56% by giving the initial "calibrating" dose of carbon_tetrachloride at the peak of the phenobarbitone induced enlargement_of_the_liver 
Attenuation of the lithium induced diabetes-insipidus-like_syndrome by amiloride in rats.
The effect of amiloride on lithium induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl 
In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium induced diabetes-insipidus-like_syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level.
The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic_disorder with agoraphobia  and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured.
METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic_disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo.
Compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression  enuresis  disinhibition and aggression  and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability  impaired_memory  weight_loss and ataxia 
Dup_753 prevents the development of puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephrosis 
The appearance of nephrotic_syndromes such as proteinuria  hypoalbuminemia  hypercholesterolemia and increase in blood_nitrogen_urea  induced in rats by injection of puromycin_aminonucleoside was markedly inhibited by oral administration of Dup_753 (losartan , a novel angiotensin_II receptor antagonist, at a dose of 1 or 2 mg/kg per day.
Sodium_bicarbonate alleviates penile_pain induced by intracavernous injections for erectile_dysfunction 
In an attempt to determine whether penile_pain associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication, we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile_pain following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium_bicarbonate to the intracorporeal medications.
A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 ml. of a combination of 3 drugs: 6 mg. papaverine  100 micrograms. phentolamine and 10 micrograms. prostaglandin_E1 with (pH 7.05) or without (pH 4.17) the addition of sodium_bicarbonate (0.03 mEq.).
Of the 19 patients without sodium_bicarbonate added to the medication 11 (58%) complained of penile_pain due to the medication, while only 1 of the 19 men (5%) who received sodium_bicarbonate complained of penile_pain 
Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (octreotide  on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients.
This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months.
During treatment with octreotide  17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones  and 1 developed acute_cholecystitis requiring surgery.
After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones  8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month.
Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones  and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients.

Epidemic of liver_disease caused by hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as ozone sparing substitutes of chlorofluorocarbons 
We investigated an epidemic of liver_disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC_123  and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC_124 .
Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane  to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane 
We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver_disease 
INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver_injury in a large proportion of the exposed population.
Patients given prilocaine were more likely to develop hearing_loss (10 out of 22) than those given bupivacaine (4 out of 22) (P < 0.05).

Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure.
Tamoxifen (TAM , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast_cancer  induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic_anemia 
This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM induced hemolytic_anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms.
TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration.
The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions.
The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T  and alpha-tocopherol_acetate (alpha-TAc  (inactivated functional hydroxyl  indicating that TAM induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage.
This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM induced hemolysis 
Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K +) from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis  according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves.
These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided.
Therefore, TAM induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane.
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM  resulting in hemolytic_anemia 
Changes of sodium and ATP affinities of the cardiac (Na K -ATPase during and after nitric_oxide deficient hypertension 
Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension 
In several models of hypertension  elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue.
To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na , we studied the response of cardiac (Na K -ATPase to NO deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day N(G)-nitro-L-arginine_methyl_ester (L-NAME  for 4 four weeks.
After recovery from hypertension  the activity of (Na K -ATPase increased, due to higher affinity of the ATP binding site, as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP 
Inhibition of NO synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na -extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na -binding properties of the (Na K -ATPase.
Effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine induced tachycardia in conscious rats.
It has been shown that bromocriptine induced tachycardia  which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart.
This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine induced tachycardia in conscious rats.
Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac_hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate.
In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia 
Bromocriptine induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia  an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg).
These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine induced tachycardia to bradycardia  an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart.
Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia  we hypothesized that clonidine s developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other.
Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine induced bradycardia 
Differential effects of systemically administered ketamine and lidocaine on dynamic and static hyperalgesia induced by intradermal capsaicin in humans.
We have examined the effect of systemic administration of ketamine and lidocaine on brush-evoked (dynamic) pain and punctate-evoked (static) hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin 
Ketamine reduced both the area of brush-evoked and punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly and it tended to reduce brush-evoked pain 
Lidocaine reduced the area of punctate-evoked hyperalgesia significantly.
Cyclosporine and tacrolimus associated thrombotic_microangiopathy 
The development of thrombotic_microangiopathy (TMA  associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented.
As a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine induced TMA 
With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation, tacrolimus associated TMA has also been recognized.
However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited.
We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy.
Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft.
Repeated transient anuria following losartan administration in a patient with a solitary kidney.
We report the case of a 70-year-old hypertensive man with a solitary kidney and chronic_renal_insufficiency who developed two episodes of transient anuria after losartan administration.
Due to severe systolic_dysfunction losartan was prescribed.
Surprisingly, the first dose of 50 mg of losartan resulted in a sudden anuria  which lasted eight hours despite high-dose furosemide and amine infusion.
One week later, by mistake, losartan was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg, the patient developed a second episode of transient anuria lasting 10 hours.
In this patient, renal_artery_stenosis combined with heart_failure and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).
In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen induced nephrotoxicity  amiodarone induced lung_toxicity and doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity by a novel IH636_grape_seed_proanthocyanidin_extract 
This study assessed the ability of IH636_grape_seed_proanthocyanidin_extract (GSPE  to prevent acetaminophen (AAP  induced nephrotoxicity  amiodarone (AMI  induced lung_toxicity  and doxorubicin (DOX  induced cardiotoxicity in mice.
Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue_damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence.
Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP  AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE 
Palpebral_twitching in a depressed adolescent on citalopram 
We report a favorable response to treatment with citalopram by a 15-year-old boy with major_depression who exhibited palpebral_twitching during his first 2 weeks of treatment.
Metamizol potentiates morphine antinociception but not constipation after chronic treatment.
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and constipating effects of the combination of 3.2 mg/kg s.c. morphine with 177.8 mg/kg s.c. metamizol in acutely and chronically treated (once a day for 12 days) rats.
On the 13th day, antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception, pain induced functional impairment model, and the charcoal meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit.
In independent groups, morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment, respectively, suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects.
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment, suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine induced constipation 
Ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis 
We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma 
The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely.
OBJECTIVES: Given its preclinical success for treating substance_abuse and the increased risk of visual_field_defects (VFD  associated with cumulative lifetime exposure, we explored the effects of sub-chronic low dose GVG on cocaine induced increases in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA .
In ICH induction using 0.014-unit collagenase, heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7.6-fold.
Estradiol reduces seizure induced hippocampal_injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats.
Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal_injury induced by kainic_acid induced status_epilepticus (SE .
We compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium pilocarpine induced SE 
The extent of silver stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE  17beta-Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3-C sectors of ovariectomized rats.
Delirium during clozapine treatment: incidence and associated risk factors.
BACKGROUND: Incidence and risk factors for delirium during clozapine treatment require further clarification.
METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium  and tested associations with potential risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics.
Ketoconazole induced neurologic_sequelae 
A 77-y-old patient developed weakness_of_extremities  legs_paralysis  dysarthria and tremor 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg ketoconazole for the first time in his life.
Capsaicin (0.01-1 mm) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced increases_in_dural_and_cortical_blood_flow and provoked lacrimation.
The evoked increases_in_dural_blood_flow were also abolished by topical pre-administration of atropine (1 mm) and [Lys1, Pro2,5, Arg3,4, Tyr6]-VIP (0.1 mm), a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) antagonist, onto the exposed dura mater.
Similar to rats, systemic pilocarpine injection causes status_epilepticus (SE  and the eventual development of spontaneous seizures and mossy fiber sprouting in C57BL/6 and CD1 mice, but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice.
In Mg 2+)-free bathing medium containing bicuculline  conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices, electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and pilocarpine treated mice that did not experience SE 
In SE survivors, similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed, at a variable latency, by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3-60 s duration, which were blocked by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists.
Focal glutamate photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1-30 s duration in slices from SE survivors but not other groups.
The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice.
Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors  to seizures and death  nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits.
We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine induced seizures 
Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains.
Recurrent acute interstitial_nephritis induced by azithromycin 
A 14-year-old girl is reported with recurrent, azithromycin induced, acute interstitial_nephritis 
Valproate induced encephalopathy 
Valproate induced encephalopathy is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal epileptic individuals.
Nitro-L-arginine_methyl_ester  a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity 
The nitric_oxide (NO  inhibitor nitro-L-arginine_methyl_ester (L-NAME  may act as an otoprotectant against high-frequency_hearing_loss caused by gentamicin  but further studies are needed to confirm this.
Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and, as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO  we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside induced sensorineural_hearing_loss 
Cerebral_vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult: a case report.
Cerebral_vasculitis associated with amphetamine_abuse is well documented, and in rare cases ischaemic_stroke has been reported after methylphenidate intake in children.
We report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic_strokes 
We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy.
Cerebral_haemorrhage induced by warfarin - the influence of drug-drug interactions.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the frequency, severity and preventability of warfarin induced cerebral_haemorrhages due to warfarin and warfarin drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg  tland, Sweden.
Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether warfarin and warfarin drug interactions could have caused the cerebral_haemorrhage 
RESULTS: Among 593 patients with cerebral_haemorrhage  59 (10%) were assessed as related to warfarin treatment.
A warfarin drug interaction could have contributed to the haemorrhage in 24 (41%) of the warfarin patients and in 7 of these (12%) the bleeding complication was considered being possible to avoid.
CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin induced cerebral_haemorrhages are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate.
PURPOSE: To assess the incidence of postoperative emetic side effects after the administration of methylprednisolone and gentamicin into the posterior sub-Tenon's space at the end of routine cataract surgery.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic_kidney_disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions.
In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes_mellitus  use of N-acetylcysteine  mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups.
In patients with diabetes  SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with iopamidol and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with iodixanol (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37).
Mean post-SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol (all patients: 0.07 versus 0.12 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 10.6 micromol/L, P=0.03; patients with diabetes  0.07 versus 0.16 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 14.1 micromol/L, P=0.01).
A novel compound, maltolyl_p-coumarate  attenuates cognitive_deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models.
In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl_p-coumarate could improve cognitive_decline in scopolamine injected rats and in amyloid_beta_peptide(1-42) infused rats.
Maltolyl_p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive_deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid_beta_peptide(1-42) infused rats.
We report 3 cases of serious bleeding complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between warfarin and levofloxacin 
Mutations associated with lamivudine resistance in therapy-na  ve hepatitis_B_virus_(HBV)_infected patients with and without HIV_co-infection  implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co-infected South African patients.
This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine resistant hepatitis_B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine na  ve HBV carriers with and without human_immunodeficiency_virus_(HIV)_co-infection in South African patients.
Thirty-five lamivudine na  ve HBV_infected patients with or without HIV_co-infection were studied: 15 chronic HBV_mono-infected patients and 20 HBV HIV co-infected patients.
HBV lamivudine resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis_B patients and 10 of 20 HBV HIV co-infected patients.
To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine resistant strains in therapy-na  ve HBV HIV co-infected patients.
Sex differences in NMDA antagonist enhancement of morphine antihyperalgesia in a capsaicin model of persistent pain  comparisons to two models of acute_pain 
In acute_pain models, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of morphine to a greater extent in males than females.
To this end, persistent hyperalgesia was induced by administration of capsaicin in the tail of gonadally intact F344 rats, following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus, and tail-withdrawal latencies measured.
Enhancement of morphine antinociception by dextromethorphan was seen in both males and females in the acute_pain models, with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males.
Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients.
The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl  lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation.
In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown.
ACE_inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing_blocker (ARB  therapy reduced proteinuria development.
Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl  which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients.
Methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling.
Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons.
Because the CNS_damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity  we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation.
Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity 
We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation.
Recovery of tacrolimus associated brachial_neuritis after conversion to everolimus in a pediatric renal transplant recipient--case report and review of the literature.
Valvular_heart_disease in patients with Parkinson's_disease treated with pergolide 
Valvular_heart_abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson's_disease (PD  treated with pergolide 
METHODS: All PD patients in the Amiens area treated with pergolide were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography.
A restrictive pattern of valvular_regurgitation  suggestive of the role of pergolide  was observed in 12/30 (40%) patients including two with heart_failure 
Pergolide was discontinued in 10 patients with valvular_heart_disease  resulting in a lower regurgitation grade (p=0.01) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with heart_failure returned to nearly normal clinical examination.
BACKGROUND: Papaverine_hydrochloride is a direct-acting vasodilator used to manage vasospasm during various neurosurgical operations.
Transient cranial_nerve_dysfunction has been described in a few cases with topical papaverine 
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical papaverine for vasospasm 
Topical papaverine was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage vasospasm in a total of 11 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical papaverine for the treatment of vasospasm was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway.
Massive proteinuria and acute_renal_failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate  administration in a patient with focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis 
A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic_syndrome due to focal_segmental_glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy.
Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate_sodium  administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute_renal_failure 
Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 in doxorubicin induced nephrotic_syndrome 
Doxorubicin induced nephropathy leads to epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)-dependent volume_retention and renal fibrosis 
The aldosterone sensitive serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal fibrosis following mineralocorticoid and salt excess.
Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria (>100 mg protein/mg crea) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/-) mice leading to severe nephrotic_syndrome with ascites  lipidemia  and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes.
Plasma aldosterone levels increased in nephrotic mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK1 protein expression in sgk1(+/+) mice.
Urinary sodium excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk1(+/+) mice (15 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) than in sgk1(-/-) mice (35 +/- 5 mumol/mg crea) and was associated with a significantly higher body weight_gain in sgk1(+/+) compared with sgk1(-/-) mice (+6.6 +/- 0.7 vs. +4.1 +/- 0.8 g).
During the course of nephrotic_syndrome  serum urea concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk1(-/-) mice than in sgk1(+/+) mice leading to uremia and a reduced median survival in sgk1(-/-) mice (29 vs. 40 days in sgk1(+/+) mice).
Severe and long lasting cholestasis after high-dose co-trimoxazole treatment for Pneumocystis_pneumonia in HIV-infected patients--a report of two cases.
Pneumocystis_pneumonia (PCP , a common opportunistic_infection in HIV-infected individuals, is generally treated with high doses of co-trimoxazole 
Here, we report two cases of severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients who developed severe intrahepatic_cholestasis  and in one patient lesions mimicking liver_abscess formation on radiologic exams, during co-trimoxazole treatment for PCP 
Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients.
BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens.
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus 
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use.
In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria 
In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria day.
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic range proteinuria 
Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables.
In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria 
CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients.
This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain 
This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic_pain  neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning-dosed modafinil on sleep and daytime_sleepiness in chronic cocaine users.
Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency, as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime_sleepiness 
CONCLUSIONS: Morning-dosed modafinil promotes nocturnal sleep, normalizes sleep architecture, and decreases daytime_sleepiness in abstinent cocaine users.
Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo- and haloperidol controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar_I_disorder with or without psychotic features.
In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily (BID), asenapine at 10 mg BID, placebo, or haloperidol at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity).
Extrapyramidal_symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol  and placebo groups, respectively.
Permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin_aminonucleoside nephrosis 
Using puromycin_aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes.
Twin preterm neonates with cardiac_toxicity related to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy.
One of the twins developed complete heart_block and dilated_cardiomyopathy related to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy, a boosted protease-inhibitor agent, while the other twin developed mild bradycardia 
Learning of rats under amnesia caused by pentobarbital 
Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of amnesia produced by pentobarbital (15 mg/kg, ip) was carried out.
Angiosarcoma of the liver associated with diethylstilbestrol 
Angiosarcoma of the liver occurred in a 76-year-old man who had been treated for a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver with diethylstilbestrol for 13 years.
Role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone induced hypertension in rats. 1.
Glucocorticoid induced hypertension (GC-HT  in the rat is associated with nitric_oxide redox imbalance. 2.
We studied the role of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in dexamethasone induced hypertension (dex HT . 3.
Dex increased_SBP (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and decreased_thymus_(P_<_0.001)_and_bodyweights (P" < 0.01).
Allopurinol did not prevent dex HT 
Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone s pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic_symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics.
Drug-induced_parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%.
Simvastatin-ezetimibe induced hepatic_failure necessitating liver transplantation.
However, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe 
We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant_hepatic_failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg/day to simvastatin_10_mg-ezetimibe_40_mg day.
The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity 
Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression  were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded.
Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine_diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin_hydroxy_acid  resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity 
To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe induced liver_failure that resulted in liver transplantation.
We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes.
BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine is a very addictive, powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac_dysrhythmias  hypertension  hallucinations  and violent_behavior 
Dental patients abusing methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene, xerostomia  rampant caries ("meth_mouth ), and excessive tooth_wear 
She reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious_episodes before she started using the drug.
Thyroxine abuse: an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.
Attenuation of methamphetamine induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pretreatment.
Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine induced dopaminergic_terminal_damage 
In this study, we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide  a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the methamphetamine induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity 
Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine elicited hyperthermia three days later.
Effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of adriamycin induced nephropathy 
The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis 
Rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria  blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration.
These short-term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) without reducing albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min).
Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal_injury in adriamycin nephrosis 
Chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4.
Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy.
Ketamine sedation for the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department.
RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes).
CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution.
Prophylactic use of lamivudine with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatologic_disorders 
The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of lamivudine in hepatitis_B_virus_surface_antigen (HBs_Ag  positive patients with rheumatologic_disease 
From June 2004 to October 2006, 11 HBs_Ag positive patients with rheumatologic_diseases  who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic lamivudine therapies, were retrospectively assessed.
Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke  myocardiopathy (MP , duration of the test, mitral_regurgitation (MR  and the MZ dose.
Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway_obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use.
The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR  MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001).

Selegiline induced postural_hypotension in Parkinson's_disease  a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal.
OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom Parkinson's_Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson's_disease (PD  randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L-dopa compared with those taking L-dopa alone.
Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated with selective systolic_orthostatic_hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline 
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic_hypotension 
METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn.
RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused systolic_orthostatic_hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline  one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures.
Orthostatic_hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug.
Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced_the_supine_systolic_and_diastolic_blood_pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic_hypotension 
Explicit episodic memory for sensory-discriminative components of capsaicin induced pain  immediate and delayed ratings.
In order to address long-term pain memory, nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin (0.05, 1 and 20 microg, separated by 15 min breaks), each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals.
Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses (both p<0.001), regardless of whether first-time ratings were requested immediately, after one hour or after one day.

In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats.
TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine  quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects).
It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor.

Cardiovascular_alterations in rat fetuses exposed to calcium channel blockers.
Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new calcium channel blocker, Ro_40-5967  induced cardiovascular_alterations in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis.
The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that calcium channel blockers in general induce cardiovascular_malformations indicating a pharmacologic class effect.
Pregnant rats were administered one of these calcium channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for cardiovascular_malformations 
A low incidence of cardiovascular_malformations was observed after exposure to each of the four calcium channel blockers, but this incidence was statistically significant only for verapamil and nifedipine 
The effects of sevoflurane on lidocaine induced convulsions 
The influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine induced convulsions was studied in cats.
The convulsive threshold (mean +/- SD) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with lidocaine infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0.8%.
There was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane 
The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1.6% sevoflurane  and in 0.8% and 1.6% enflurane 
Apamin (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant.
Anti-oxidant effects of atorvastatin in dexamethasone induced hypertension in the rat. 1.
Dexamethasone (Dex  induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric_oxide (NO  deficiency and increased superoxide (O2-  production.

Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration.
A randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive_behaviors in Alzheimer's_disease 
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive_behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's_disease 
METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol  2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol  0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's_disease 
RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor_agitation 
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal_signs 
Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin induced renal_damage 
Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal_damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats.
After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9].
RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria  renal_interstitial_damage and mild focal_glomerulosclerosis 
Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin induced renal_damage in this outbred rat strain.
Clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin 
Gentamicin_sulfate and tobramycin_sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies.
In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin_sulfate or tobramycin_sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside related renal_failure  defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function.
Five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin treated patients had renal_failure 
Neuroprotective action of MPEP  a selective mGluR5 antagonist, in methamphetamine induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is associated with a decrease in dopamine outflow and inhibition of hyperthermia in rats.
Moreover, it transiently diminished the methamphetamine (10 mg/kg sc) induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature.
The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine induced toxicity 
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache  have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet 
Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia 
L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID  is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's_disease (PD  patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA 
In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS).
Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID 
Pseudo-allergic_reactions to corticosteroids  diagnosis and alternatives.

Subjects with SNHL were submitted to DFO reduction or temporary withdrawal.
CONCLUSION: The findings are indicative of DFO s contributing role in the development of hearing_impairment 
Design and analysis of the HYPREN-trial: safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive_heart_failure 
Since the introduction of angiotensin_converting_enzyme_(ACE)_inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive_heart_failure  cases of severe hypotension  especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported.
To assess the safety of the ACE_inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment.
Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%).

Reversible inferior_colliculus_lesion in metronidazole induced encephalopathy  magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging.
OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible inferior_colliculus_lesions in metronidazole induced encephalopathy  to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years).
They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs.
The incidence of postoperative respiratory apnoea was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i.v. infusion of morphine (mean 73.6 mg) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine (mean 192 mg) in the 24-h period following upper abdominal surgery.
Both obstructive (P less than 0.05) and central apnoea (P less than 0.05) occurred more frequently in patients who had a morphine infusion.
Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar_atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication.
Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume.
We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar_atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar_atrophy in the remaining patients.
Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of myocardial_damage in doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy rats, and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings.
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial_damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX  induced cardiomyopathy  and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac_disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model.
RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period.
Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis 
CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic_injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial_damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes.
The reduction of cyclosporine  or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain 
The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS  is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans.
We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response.
The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study.
However, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients.
Neurotoxicity of halogenated_hydroxyquinolines  clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan.
An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated_hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan.
In six of the probable cases the neurological_disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period.
This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis_enteropathica 
Epileptic_seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic_acid in rats.
However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic_seizures 
We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS.
FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours.
The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA 
Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized_seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats.
INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic_acid retains its convulsive action within FS.
A diet promoting sugar_dependency causes behavioral_cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine 
The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral_cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine 
The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine  or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection).
D-penicillamine induced angiopathy in rats.
Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity 
Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity 
The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac_dysfunction 
We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute_leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR -containing regimen.
Thirteen patients with acute_leukemia were treated with a DNR containing regimen.
On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart_failure given DNR  even at more than 700 mg/m(2).
Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation_of_the_aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal_atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse_limb_deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic_hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4).
Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic_left_heart_syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial_septal_defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft_lip with cleft_palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Reassuringly, penicillins  erythromycins  and cephalosporins  although used commonly by pregnant women, were not associated with many birth_defects 
Patients treated with alkylating_agents have an increased risk of development of acute_nonlymphocytic_leukemia  and both alkylating_agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's_lymphoma 
Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder.
There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid_arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased.
Patterns of hepatic_injury induced by methyldopa 
Twelve patients with liver_disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977.
One patient died, having presented in hepatic_failure  and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months.
The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant_hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa induced hepatitis 
A phase I/II study of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first-line therapy for head_and_neck_cancers  preliminary results.
Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head_and_neck_cancer  and the paclitaxel cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian_cancer patients.
We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head_and_neck_carcinoma 
The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits.
Paclitaxel cisplatin is an effective first-line regimen for locoregionally advanced head_and_neck_cancer and continued study is warranted.
A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (Pirarubicin  was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors 
Differential effects of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane  on pharmacologically induced seizures 
Gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH , the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane  has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol (PTZ  3 h after exposure to gamma-HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma-HCH (Vohland et al. 1981).
In this study, the severity of response to other seizure inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg/kg gamma-HCH 
One hour after the administration of gamma-HCH  the activity of seizure inducing agents was increased, regardless of their mechanism, while 24 h after gamma-HCH a differential response was observed.
Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin (PTX  was significantly decreased; however, seizure activity due to 3-mercaptopropionic_acid (MPA , bicuculline (BCC , methyl_6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-B-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM , or strychnine (STR  was not different from control.
The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma-HCH  since the response to only these two seizure inducing agents is decreased.
Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas 
Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin  whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known.
However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin  which is infrequently reported.
CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe.
Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen.
Phase II study of the amsacrine analogue CI-921 (NSC_343499  in non-small_cell_lung_cancer 
Alpha-lipoic_acid prevents mitochondrial_damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy 
The study investigates if alpha-lipoic_acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity  if mitochondrial_damage plays a critical role in toxic_neurodegenerative_cascade  and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic_acid depend on mitochondria protection.
We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral_neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin  two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs.
This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic_acid in preventing axonal_damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic_acid 
Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial_impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons.
Alpha-lipoic_acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial_toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties.
In conclusion mitochondrial_toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity 
Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%.
Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes  with a relative risk reduction of 36%.

The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog: a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man.
Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic_disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized.
In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia  neutropenia  and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment.
A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone 
Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin  the hematologic_syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone -treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days).
A pyridoxine dependent behavioral_disorder unmasked by isoniazid

Pneumonitis  bilateral pleural_effusions  echocardiographic evidence of cardiac_tamponade  and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43-year-old man, who was receiving long-term sulfasalazine therapy for chronic ulcerative_colitis 
It is suggested that the patient had sulfasalazine induced lupus  which manifested with serositis and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms.
While there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy, many individuals can be started on either the 25/100 or controlled-release formula, following the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa levodopa to the point of "normality," which can lead to toxicity 
Other possible adverse effects--such as gastrointestinal_disorders  orthostatic_hypotension  levodopa induced psychosis  sleep_disturbances or parasomnias  or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment.
Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal_symptoms  and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam

Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting  without increasing pain  after sevoflurane for day surgery.
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane  postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting occurs frequently.
METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients.
RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting  but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl dexamethasone  respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013).
Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting 
Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative_nausea_and_vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034).
Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl 
Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane sparing effect and increased respiratory_depression  hypotension and bradycardia

The present study was designed to study the effect of histamine H(3)-receptor ligands on neuroleptic induced catalepsy  apomorphine induced climbing behavior and amphetamine induced locomotor activities in mice.
Catalepsy was induced by haloperidol (2 mg/kg p.o.), while apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg s.c.) and amphetamine (2 mg/kg s.c.) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities, respectively.
(R)-alpha-methylhistamine (RAMH  (5 microg i.c.v.) and thioperamide (THP  (15 mg/kg i.p.), per se did not cause catalepsy 
Administration of THP (3.75, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg i.p.) 1 h prior to haloperidol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the catalepsy times (P < 0.05).
On amphetamine induced hyperactivity  THP (3.75 and 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) reduced locomotor time, distance traveled and average speed (P < 0.05).
THP exhibited an antipsychotic-like profile by potentiating haloperidol induced catalepsy  reducing amphetamine induced hyperactivity and reducing apomorphine induced climbing in mice.
Transient platypnea-orthodeoxia-like_syndrome induced by propafenone overdose in a young woman with Ebstein's_anomaly 
This shunt of blood via a patent_foramen_ovale occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure, and was probably precipitated by a propafenone overdose 
A Phase II trial of cisplatin plus WR-2721 (amifostine  for metastatic breast_carcinoma  an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E8188).
BACKGROUND: Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast_carcinoma 
Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin  the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity  ototoxicity  and neurotoxicity  have limited its use as a treatment for breast_carcinoma 
Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity  ototoxicity  and neuropathy were reduced.
METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast_carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease.

Components of lemon essential oil attenuate dementia induced by scopolamine 
The anti-dementia effects of s-limonene and s-perillyl_alcohol were observed using the passive avoidance test (PA) and the open field habituation test (OFH).
These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve memory_impaired by scopolamine  however, s-perillyl_alcohol relieved the deficit_of_associative_memory in PA only, and did not improve non-associative memory significantly in OFH.
The selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist Ro4368554 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of memory_deficiency in the rat.
Both, Ro4368554 (3 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and metrifonate (10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively) reversed memory_deficits induced by scopolamine and TRP depletion (10 mg/kg, i.p., and 3 mg/kg, p.o., respectively).
Lone atrial_fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation.
Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in CRL:(WI)WUBR Wistar rats--DFU and piroxicam study.
The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam  and selective (DFU  5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl)_phenyl-2(5H)-furanon  COX-2 inhibitors.
The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam  selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data.
RESULTS: Maternal toxicity  intrauterine_growth_retardation  and increase_of_external_and_skeletal_variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam 
Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose.
Protective efficacy of neuroactive steroids against cocaine kindled-seizures in mice.
Neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric_acid (GABA A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration (seizure kindling).
Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one , pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one  and ganaxolone (a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one  were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine kindled seizures in male, Swiss-Webster mice.
Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg cocaine for 5 days.
All of these positive GABA A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures  whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling.
These are nephrotoxic  but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open.
In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described.
The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02).
The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05).
Effect of fucoidan treatment on collagenase induced intracerebral_hemorrhage in rats.
We tested the sulfated polysaccharide fucoidan  which has been reported to reduce inflammatory brain_damage  in a rat model of intracerebral_hemorrhage induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus.
Fucoidan treated rats exhibited evidence of impaired_blood_clotting and hemodilution  had larger hematomas  and tended to have less inflammation in the vicinity of the hematoma after three days.
Paracetamol associated coma  metabolic_acidosis  renal and hepatic failure.
In two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepatitis 
Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin_E1 induced hypotension and haemodilution on human hepatic function.
Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin_E1 (PGE1  induced hypotension and haemodilution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery.
Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%.
Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min.
In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation.
Levodopa induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's_disease  filling the bench-to-bedside gap.
Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's_disease 
However, the long-term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias 
Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa induced dyskinesias  their pathogenesis is still unclear.
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats.
Cardioprotective effect of salvianolic_acid_A on isoproterenol induced myocardial_infarction in rats.
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of salvianolic_acid_A on isoproterenol induced myocardial_infarction in rats.
In addition, mitochondrial respiratory_dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ADP O was observed in isoproterenol treated rats.
Administration of salvianolic_acid_A for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol induced cardiac_dysfunction and myocardial_injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function.
The protective role of salvianolic_acid_A against isoproterenol induced myocardial_damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination.
Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino_acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine induced seizure in rats.
VPU was more potent than VPA  exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg.
Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino_acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate 
Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin 
He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d PO to treat an upper_respiratory_tract_infection 7 days prior.
The patient had suffered a previous episode of "acute hepatitis of unknown origin," that occurred after telithromycin usage.
Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse_drug_reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug induced toxic_hepatitis 
Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time.
Spironolactone induced renal_insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart_failure 
BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart_failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal_insufficiency (0%).
Because treatments for heart_failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice.
We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal_insufficiency in heart_failure patients treated with spironolactone 
METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart_failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice.
Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K +) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal_insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal_failure (n = 34).
Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes  had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134).
Patients who developed renal_insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine  required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls.
BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic 
Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD  n=748; CRF  sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD  n=45.
Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal_syndrome  higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine 
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively.
Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal_syndrome 
Effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute_stroke 
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial (INWEST) found a correlation between nimodipine induced reduction_in_blood_pressure (BP) and an unfavorable outcome in acute_stroke 
METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic_stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94).
Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction_in_systolic_BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days.
CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute_stroke 
Transient_neurologic_symptoms after spinal anesthesia: a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine 
BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that transient_neurologic_symptoms (TNSs  frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine 
Accordingly, the present, prospective double-blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs 
RESULTS: Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs  1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine (P = 0.03) had them, and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs 
The role of nicotine in smoking-related cardiovascular_disease 
Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular_disease 
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis  but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect.
Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans.
Seizure resulting from a venlafaxine overdose 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of venlafaxine overdose 
CASE SUMMARY: A 40-year-old woman with major_depression took an overdose of venlafaxine in an apparent suicide attempt.
After the ingestion of 26 venlafaxine 50-mg tablets, the patient experienced a witnessed generalized seizure 
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of venlafaxine overdose that resulted in a generalized seizure 
Two groups of patients receiving tacrolimus were compared over a period of 1 year, one group comprising hypertensive patients who were receiving nifedipine  and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving nifedipine 
Sinus_arrest associated with continuous-infusion cimetidine 
The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of cimetidine is infrequently associated with the development of bradyarrhythmias 
A 40-year-old man with leukemia and no history of cardiac_disease developed recurrent, brief episodes of apparent sinus_arrest while receiving continuous-infusion cimetidine 50 mg/hour.
The arrhythmias were temporally related to cimetidine administration, disappeared after dechallenge, and did not recur during ranitidine treatment.
Composition of gall_bladder_stones associated with octreotide  response to oral ursodeoxycholic_acid 
Octreotide  an effective treatment for acromegaly  induces gall_bladder_stones in 13-60% of patients.
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall_stones 
Chemical analysis of gall_stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients, showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight.
After one year of treatment, five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial (n = 3) or complete (n = 2) gall_stone dissolution, suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich.
Cardiovascular_complications associated with terbutaline treatment for preterm_labor 
Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2-chloroprocaine-CE seven (35%) developed hind-limb paralysis 
None of the animals that received bupivacaine  normal saline, or normal saline titrated to a pH 3.0 developed hind-limb paralysis 
Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2-chloroprocaine-CE  13 showed subpial_necrosis  the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal.
Early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma 
Adriamycin (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T1 (O-A) bladder_tumors 
Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy.
Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAID) such as indomethacin 
We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq/l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration.
As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly, this course of events is suggestive of a cause-and-effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia 
Ventricular_tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after ritodrine therapy: interaction with anesthetics.
This case illustrates that patients receiving ritodrine for preterm_labor may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of ritodrine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section.
Such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular_complications even after cessation of an infusion of ritodrine 
Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen induced rat prolactinomas after bromocriptine treatment.
To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine (3 mg/kg of body weight).
However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells.

Serial epilepsy caused by levodopa/carbidopa administration in two patients on hemodialysis.
Two patients with similar clinical features are presented: both patients had chronic_renal_failure  on hemodialysis for many years but recently begun on a high-flux dialyzer; both had been receiving a carbidopa/levodopa preparation; and both had the onset of hallucinosis and recurrent seizures  which were refractory to anticonvulsants.
Effect of L-alpha-glyceryl-phosphorylcholine on amnesia caused by scopolamine 
The present study was carried out to test the effects of L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine (L-alpha-GFC  on memory_impairment induced by scopolamine in man.
Seizures induced by the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine in rats.
The half-life (t1/2) of cocaine is relatively short, but some of the consequences of its use, such as seizures and strokes  can occur hours after exposure.
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine  benzoylecgonine (BE , to cause seizures 
BE Induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of cocaine 
Whereas cocaine induced seizures were best characterized as brief, generalized, and tonic and resulted in death  those induced by BE were prolonged, often multiple and mixed in type, and rarely resulted in death 
BE Injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine injected animals without seizures

However, a bolus of epinephrine injected through an alternative catheter provoked a hypertensive crisis.
Long-term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral_neurotoxicity of paclitaxel 
Toxic peripheral_neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel (PAC , although glutamate and its closely related amino_acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate PAC neurotoxicity 
This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC induced peripheral_neuropathy in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study.
Forty-three ovarian_cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P).
Attentional modulation of perceived pain intensity in capsaicin induced secondary hyperalgesia 
However, it is not known that how pain intensity ratings are affected by attention in capsaicin induced secondary hyperalgesia 
Furthermore, it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary hyperalgesia is very similar to that of capsaicin untreated, control condition.
Testosterone dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt sensitive rats.
In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal_injury

Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin (mToR) inhibitors, especially sirolimus  in renal transplant recipients with chronic_allograft_nephropathy 
Whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received sirolimus de novo.
Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic_acid levels, prolactin signaling, and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol 
We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen induced LH surge.
Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol 
These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid dependent manner.
We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic_lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice.
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats.
QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine induced seizures  a model of temporal_lobe_epilepsy  have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility genes.

Microangiopathic_hemolytic_anemia complicating FK506 (tacrolimus  therapy.
We describe 3 episodes of microangiopathic_hemolytic_anemia (MAHA  in 2 solid organ recipients under FK506 (tacrolimus  therapy.
In both cases, discontinuation of FK506 and treatment with plasma exchange, fresh frozen plasma replacement, corticosteroids  aspirin  and dipyridamole led to resolution of MAHA 
In one patient, reintroduction of FK506 led to rapid recurrence of MAHA 
FK506 associated MAHA is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication.

Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy 
To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac_damage due to doxorubicin  a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects.
Effects of aminophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular_fibrillation during respiratory_failure 
The effects of aminophylline on the ventricular_fibrillation threshold during normal acid-base conditions and during respiratory_failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs.
During the infusion of aminophylline  the ventricular_fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of oxygen (PO2  and carbon_dioxide (CO2  were kept within normal limits.
When respiratory_failure was produced by hypoventilation (pH 7.05 to 7.25; PC02 70 to 100 mm Hg: P02 20 to 40 mm Hg), infusion of aminophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular_fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control level.
Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for rizatriptan 10 mg versus ergotamine caffeine in migraine 
Rizatriptan is a selective 5-HT 1B/1D) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migraine 
This randomized double- blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 rizatriptan 10 mg tablet to 2 ergotamine 1 mg/caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therapy.
Faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference, cited by 67.3% of patients preferring rizatriptan and 54.2% of patients who preferred ergotamine caffeine 
The co-primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of rizatriptan 
Forty-nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after rizatriptan  compared with 24.3% treated with ergotamine caffeine (p < or = 0.001), rizatriptan being superior within 1 h of treatment.
Headache relief at 2 h was 75.9% for rizatriptan and 47.3% for ergotamine caffeine (p < or = 0.001), with rizatriptan being superior to ergotamine caffeine within 30 min of dosing.
Almost 36% of patients taking rizatriptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h, compared to 20% of patients on ergotamine caffeine (p < or = 0.001).
Rizatriptan was also superior to ergotamine caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea  vomiting  phonophobia or photophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake (p < or = 0.001).
Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic_microangiopathy (characterized by renal_insufficiency  microangiopathic_hemolytic_anemia  and usually thrombocytopenia  after treatment with cisplatin  bleomycin  and a vinca_alkaloid 
Salvage therapy with nelarabine  etoposide  and cyclophosphamide in relapsed/refractory paediatric T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma.
A combination of 5 d of nelarabine (AraG  with 5 d of etoposide (VP  and cyclophosphamide (CPM  and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed T-cell leukaemia or lymphoma.
The most common side effects attributable to the AraG included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal_pain 
Haematological_toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies.
A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis  fever  lymphadenopathy and hepatitis  beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid_arthritis

Recurrent seizures were treated with diazepam and broad complex tachycardia was successfully treated with adenosine 
Bradykinin receptors antagonists and nitric_oxide synthase inhibitors in vincristine and streptozotocin induced hyperalgesia in chemotherapy and diabetic_neuropathy rat model.
PURPOSE: The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive NO synthase (L-NOArg; 1.0 mg/kg ip), a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (L-NIL; 1.0 mg/kg ip) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal NO synthase (7-NI; 0.1 mg/kg ip), on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B2 and B1 receptors: D-Arg-[Hyp3,Thi5,D-Tic7,Oic8] bradykinin (HOE_140  70 nmol/kg ip) or des_Arg10_HOE_140 (70 nmol/kg ip) respectively, in model of diabetic (streptozotocin induced) and toxic (vincristine induced) neuropathy was investigated.
RESULTS: The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic_hyperalgesia 
It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine 
Moreover, L-NOArg and 7-NI but not L-NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE_140 or des-Arg10HOE_140 in toxic_neuropathy 
In streptozotocin induced hyperalgesia  inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin  whereas in vincristine induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway.
Cardiac_toxicity observed in association with high-dose cyclophosphamide based chemotherapy for metastatic breast_cancer 
STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel  melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide  thiotepa  and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast_cancer 
Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast_cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive_heart_failure (CHF  and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension  prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes_mellitus  prior use of anthracyclines  and left-sided chest irradiation.
RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%.
Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide related cardiac_toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature.
Inappropriate use of carbamazepine and vigabatrin in typical absence_seizures

Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic_jerks  which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine 
Hemolytic_anemia associated with the use of omeprazole 
We report the first case of a serious short-term adverse reaction with the use of omeprazole  hemolytic_anemia 
The patient developed weakness, lethargy  and shortness_of_breath 2 days after starting therapy with omeprazole 
The use and toxicity of didanosine (ddI  in HIV_antibody-positive individuals intolerant to zidovudine (AZT  One hundred and fifty-one patients intolerant to zidovudine (AZT  received didanosine (ddI  to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg/day.
Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic_anemia 
BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis 
METHODS: Fourteen patients chronically_infected_with_hepatitis_C_virus were treated by pegylated_interferon_alpha_2a and ribavirin 
CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis_C and we could not find any relation.
Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate 
Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood.
Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric_oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate  a previously proposed therapy for cocaine_addiction  were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats.
(+/-)-PG-9 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and dicyclomine (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test.
Affinity profiles of (+/-)-PG-9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for M2, guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4), have shown an M4/M1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-amnesic effect induced by (+/-)-PG-9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels.
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for control of intractable cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis 
We report a case of intractable hemorrhagic cystitis due to cyclophosphamide therapy for Wegener's_granulomatosis 
Conservative treatment, including bladder irrigation with physiological saline and instillation of prostaglandin_F2_alpha  failed to totally control hemorrhage 
The results have shown that the degradation product p-choloroaniline is not a significant factor in chlorhexidine-digluconate associated erosive cystitis 
A high percentage of kanamycin colistin and povidone-iodine irrigations were associated with erosive cystitis and suggested a possible complication with human usage.
In the double blind study with haloperidol  both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of psychotic_syndromes_belonging_predominantly_to_the_schizophrenia_group 
Curcumin ameliorates cognitive_dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats.
The antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive_impairment on chronic use.
Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone  and carbamazepine induced cognitive_impairment and oxidative stress in rats.
The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment_of_learning_and_memory as well as an increased oxidative stress.
Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive_impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs.
These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration_of_cognitive_functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations.
Pyrrolidine_dithiocarbamate protects the piriform cortex in the pilocarpine status_epilepticus model.
Both, production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of NF-kappaB have been implicated in severe neuronal_damage in different sub-regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices.
The effect of PDTC on status_epilepticus associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine model.
Treatment with 150 mg/kg PDTC before and following status_epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100%.
Administration of 50 mg/kg PDTC (low-dose) did not exert major effects on the development of a status_epilepticus or the mortality rate.
A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle- and PDTC treated rats following status_epilepticus 
In conclusion, the NF-kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant PDTC protected the piriform cortex, whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal_loss 
These data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-kappaB plays a more central role in seizure associated neuronal_damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus.
Development of levodopa induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and/or duration of symptoms.
Levodopa induced dyskinesias (LIDs  present a major problem for the long-term management of Parkinson's_disease (PD  patients.
Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP induced parkinsonism  the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs 
Monkeys with acute (short-term) MPTP exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration.
In contrast, monkeys with long-term MPTP exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs (e.g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration).
Propylthiouracil induced perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-positive vasculitis in conjunction with pericarditis 
OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of propylthiouracil induced vasculitis manifesting with pericarditis 
METHODS: We present the first case report of a woman with hyperthyroidism treated with propylthiouracil in whom a syndrome of pericarditis  fever  and glomerulonephritis developed.
A literature review revealed no prior reports of pericarditis in anti-MPO pANCA-positive vasculitis associated with propylthio-_uracil therapy.
Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta-carboline induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other GABA A) receptor ligands.
Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to seizures induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl_beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM , an inverse agonist of the GABA A) receptor benzodiazepine site.
We measured diazepam induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, diazepam induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and picrotoxin  and pentylenetetrazol induced seizures after i.p. injections.
Analgesic effect of intravenous ketamine in cancer patients on morphine therapy: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study.
Pain not responsive to morphine is often problematic.
Animal and clinical studies have suggested that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  antagonists, such as ketamine  may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic_pain 
A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of ketamine (0.25 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) was given to 10 cancer patients whose pain was unrelieved by morphine in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, double-dose study.
Ketamine  but not saline solution, significantly reduced the pain intensity in almost all the patients at both doses.
Ketamine can improve morphine analgesia in difficult pain syndromes, such as neuropathic_pain 
PURPOSE: We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1,022 patients referred because of erectile_dysfunction and compared the data with history, results of physical examination, other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost-effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities.
Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low_sexual_desire  gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml.
Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone_heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia 
Two pituitary_tumors were discovered after testosterone determination.
Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic_dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile_dysfunction (definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [36%] after androgen therapy, normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42%).
Determining testosterone only in cases of low_sexual_desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40% of the cases with low testosterone  including 37% of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile_dysfunction cannot justify their routine determination.
We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low_sexual_desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years.
Thiopentone pretreatment for propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients.
This study investigated propofol injection pain in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia.
Comparison of i.v. glycopyrrolate and atropine in the prevention of bradycardia and arrhythmias following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children.
The effectiveness of administration of glycopyrrolate 5 and 10 micrograms kg-1 and atropine 10 and 20 micrograms kg-1 i.v. immediately before the induction of anaesthesia, to prevent arrhythmia and bradycardia following repeated doses of suxamethonium in children, was studied.
Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen 
Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine 
Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP).
The frequency of sound induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen 
In the absence of caffeine  acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS).
Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol induced tachycardia 
Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular_tachyarrhythmia

Adverse effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on nephrosclerosis in rats with renovascular_hypertension 
The effect of a 6-week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria  renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular_hypertension 
Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, hypertensive rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated hypertensive controls (n = 8), enalapril treated (n = 8), or nitrendipine treated (n = 10).
Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment.
In contrast, in the nitrendipine treated group albuminuria increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the hypertensive controls.
Furthermore, glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine treated group compared with the hypertensive controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04).

The effect of humoral modulators on the morphine induced increase_in_locomotor_activity of mice was studied.
The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg of morphine HC1 produced a marked increase_in_locomotor_activity in mice.
The morphine induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine 
In contrast, both methscopolamine and neostigmine  which do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine 
On the other hand, pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalamine (3 X 320 mg/kg i.p., 24 hr), a serotonin depletor, caused no significant change in the hyperactivity 
Mechanisms of FK_506 induced hypertension in the rat. -Tacrolimus (FK_506  is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant.
The clinical utility of FK_506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity 
To clarify the mechanisms of FK_506 induced hypertension  we studied the chronic effects of FK_506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric_oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels.
In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR_139317 on FK_506 induced hypertension in rats was studied.
The administration of FR_139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK_506 induced hypertension in rats.

The effects of the adjunctive bupropion on male sexual_dysfunction induced by a selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor  a double-blind placebo-controlled and randomized study.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained-release (SR) on male sexual_dysfunction (SD  induced by a selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor (SSRI , as SD is a common side-effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined.
In linear regression analyses the CGI-SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD  type of SSRI used and age.
CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs 
Lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis_B virus reactivation in hepatitis-B_surface_antigen (HBSAG  seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.
In this study, cancer patients who have solid and hematological_malignancies with chronic HBV_infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine 
In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient (2.7%) of 37 patients (p < 0.006).
Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy.
Ginsenoside_Rg1 restores the impairment_of_learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats.

A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bruising and pain 
AIM: This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin 
BACKGROUND: Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described, the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented.
Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper.
CONCLUSIONS: It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin 
Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial_dyskinesia in rats.
Reserpine  and haloperidol induced orofacial_dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive_dyskinesia (TD  whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress.
In the present study, the authors induced orofacial_dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats.
Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial_diskinesia 
Acute_psychosis due to treatment with phenytoin in a nonepileptic patient.
The case of a nonepileptic patient who developed psychosis following phenytoin treatment for trigeminal_neuralgia is described.
The effect of treatment with gum_Arabic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats: a preliminary study.
In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum_Arabic on acute_renal_failure induced by gentamicin (GM  nephrotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione (GSH  in the kidney cortex, and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections.
The results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum_Arabic and GM significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239%, respectively (compared to 432 and 346%, respectively, in rats treated with cellulose and GM , and decreased that of cortical GSH by 21% (compared to 27% in the cellulose plus GM group) The GM induced proximal tubular_necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given GM together with gum_Arabic than in those given GM and cellulose.
It could be inferred that gum_Arabic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of GM nephrotoxicity 
Visual_hallucinations associated with zonisamide 
Zonisamide is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seizures 
Although visual_hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent, we describe three patients who experienced complex visual_hallucinations and altered mental status after zonisamide treatment was begun or its dosage increased.
GLEPP1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase (Ptpro) in rat PAN nephrosis 
Puromycin_aminonucleoside nephrosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin_aminonucleoside (PAN  20 mg/100g BW).
Tissues were analyzed at 0, 5, 7, 11, 21, 45, 80 and 126 days after PAN injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process effacement (days 5-11) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis (days 45-126).
Ticlopidine induced aplastic_anemia  report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature.
In this study, three Chinese patients with ticlopidine induced aplastic_anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed.
Agranulocytosis occurred 3-20 weeks after initiation of ticlopidine  so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended.
Treatment for ticlopidine induced aplastic_anemia with colony-stimulating factors seemed to have little effect.
Amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial (pre-test), and pre-test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training trial.
Similarly, pre-test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine induced amnesia  but not significantly; and pre-test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide induced amnesia 
Apomorphine  a nonselective dopamine_agonist  was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects, its ability to induce hypothermia  and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent brain.
In rats, detection of apomorphine induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions.
Moreover, test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug induced hypothermia 
Tricuspid_valve_regurgitation and lithium_carbonate toxicity in a newborn infant.
A newborn with massive tricuspid_regurgitation  atrial_flutter  congestive_heart_failure  and a high serum lithium level is described.
This is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid_regurgitation and atrial_flutter  and the 11th described patient with cardiac_disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Lithium_carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital_heart_disease when taken during early pregnancy.
Phenobarbital induced dyskinesia in a neurologically-impaired child.
A 2-year-old child with known neurologic_impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seizures 
On repeat challenge with phenobarbital  the dyskinesia recurred.
Valproic_acid (VPA  was given to 24 epileptic patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs.
Ammonia (NH3  was higher in patients who, during continuous therapy, complained of drowsiness (7 patients) than in those who were symptom-free (17 patients), although VPA plasma levels were similar in both groups.
Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of haloperidol induced catalepsy and a partial prevention of apomorphine induced hyperactivity 
Development of isoproterenol induced cardiac_hypertrophy 
The development of cardiac_hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol (ISO  (0.3 mg/kg body weight).
These data indicate that the adaptive response to ISO shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA.
Co-carcinogenic effect of retinyl_acetate on forestomach_carcinogenesis of male F344 rats induced with butylated_hydroxyanisole 
The potential modifying effect of retinyl_acetate (RA  on butylated_hydroxyanisole (BHA  induced rat forestomach_tumorigenesis was examined.
In groups given 2% BHA  although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of forestomach_tumors (squamous_cell_papilloma and carcinoma  to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with carcinoma  from 15% (3/20, one rat with carcinoma  in the group given RA free water.
In rats given 1% BHA  RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the BHA induced epithelial_hyperplasia 
Tumors  all papillomas  were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration.
Ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil induced muscle_rigidity 
Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin  a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle_rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil 
Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil 
Despite the absence of rigidity  animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone.
Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate induced rigidity  although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.
Use of glycopyrronium 5 micrograms kg-1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and, given 1 min before the edrophonium  was sufficient to minimize early, edrophonium induced bradycardias 
Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl induced muscular_rigidity in the rat.
Whereas muscular_rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s).
Such an induced muscular_rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin 
We describe a 42-year-old woman who developed superior sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis associated with prolonged epsilon-aminocaproic_acid therapy for menorrhagia 
Although increased risk of thromboembolic_disease has been reported during treatment with epsilon-aminocaproic_acid  cerebral_sinus_thrombosis has not been previously described.
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high-dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation.
In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna  which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis 
In contrast, two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks.
The most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flumazenil group and nausea and injection-site pain in the placebo group.
Hepatic adenomas and focal_nodular_hyperplasia of the liver in young women on oral_contraceptives  case reports.
Two cases of hepatic adenoma and one of focal_nodular_hyperplasia presumably associated with the use of oral_contraceptives  are reported.
Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin induced thrombocytopenia 
Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy.
Characteristic of the entity is arterial_occlusion by platelet-fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy, preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millimeter.
The common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin induced platelet_aggregation 
Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol induced acute_liver_failure 
BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol induced acute_liver_failure remains unknown.
AIM: To examine whether paracetamol induced acute_liver_failure increases long-term mortality.
METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol induced acute_liver_injury  hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004.
On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol induced liver_injury had caused an acute_liver_failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute_liver_failure died of liver_disease  whereas suicides were frequent in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol induced acute_liver_failure did not affect long-term mortality.
Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine induced psychosis in a Japanese population.
The serotonin 6 (5-HT ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine  and d-amphetamine induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT  receptor antagonist.
These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia  and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT  receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic_disorders 
The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH  induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid_type_schizophrenia 
Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT  gene (HTR6) with METH induced psychosis 
METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population.
RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis.
In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH induced psychosis patients, respectively.
Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion_hydrochloride induced seizures in mice.
BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion induced seizures 
METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion_HCl 120 mg/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice.
RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion_HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1.
Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion_HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection.
Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin induced epileptiform_activity in anesthetized rats.
Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research.
In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin induced epileptiform_activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats.
After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G_potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded.
Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin induced epileptiform_activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis.
Although dexmedetomidine sedation was associated with a 16% incidence of bradycardia  all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20% of age-adjusted normal range and oxygen saturations were 95% or higher.
Methamphetamine causes alterations in the MAP kinase-related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased aggressiveness 
Aggressive_behaviors have been reported in patients who suffer from some psychiatric_disorders  and are common in methamphetamine (METH  abusers.
Herein, we report that multiple (but not single) injections of METH significantly increased aggressiveness in male CD-1 mice.
This increase in aggressiveness was not secondary to METH induced hyperactivity 
Lamotrigine associated with exacerbation or de novo myoclonus in idiopathic_generalized_epilepsies 
Five patients with idiopathic_generalized_epilepsies (IGE  treated with lamotrigine (LTG  experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of myoclonic_jerks (MJ .
In three patients, LTG exacerbated MJ in a dose-dependent manner with early aggravation during titration.
MJ disappeared when LTG dose was decreased by 25 to 50%.
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in levodopa induced dyskinesia are unclear.
Assessment of the onset and persistence of amnesia during procedural sedation with propofol 
Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for hepatitis_B and rubella  administration of the hepatitis_B vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of hepatitis_B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis_B_surface_antigen positive mothers, rubella immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women.
All infants who were born to hepatitis_B_surface_antigen positive mothers also received hepatitis_B immune globulin.
Doxorubicin is an anti-tumor agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis.
Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in doxorubicin nephrosis 
BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin induces a self-perpetuating nephropathy characterized by early glomerular_and_late-onset_tubular_lesions in rats.
RESULTS: The 'long-term' group had significant glomerular_and_tubular_lesions  depressed activities of mtDNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) and increased citrate synthase activity.
Amphotericin_B induced seizures in a patient with AIDS 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of multiple episodes of seizure activity in an AIDS patent following amphotericin_B infusion.
CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man experienced recurrent grand_mal_seizures during intravenous infusion of amphotericin_B  then petit mal seizures as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time.
Despite administration of phenytoin and lorazepam  the seizures persisted and occurred only during amphotercin_B administration.
The patient had a history of alcohol_abuse  alcohol intake as well as withdrawal can also cause seizures 
Didanosine also has a potential for inducing seizures 
The time course of events suggested that amphotericin_B was the cause of the seizures in this AIDS patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Amphotericin_B seems to be the probable cause of the seizures 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of tobramicyn on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity

Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative (SM-5887  on normal heart and doxorubicin induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs.
This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs.
Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy  while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM-5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations.
To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM-5887  low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg).
The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment.
On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy 
Neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in the pilocarpine model of temporal_lobe_epilepsy

Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary_stenosis  correlation with thallium 201 single-photon emission tomography.
During dipyridamole induced hyperemia  12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary_stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography.
The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole induced hyperemia 
Thallium 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole induced hyperemia  the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03).
Potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy 
The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy  18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal_insufficiency  were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital.

OBJECTIVE: To report a case of fatal liver_failure possibly associated with concurrent use of bupropion and carbimazole 
CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old Chinese man with a history of hyperthyroidism had been treated with carbimazole and propranolol for the past 5 years.
The likelihood that bupropion induced hepatotoxicity in our patient was possible, based on the Naranjo probability scale.
DISCUSSION: Although there is increasing evidence of hepatotoxicity induced by bupropion  this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from acute_liver_failure in a patient receiving bupropion while on concomitant treatment with carbimazole 
Long-term oestrogen only HT significantly increased the risk of venous_thrombo-embolism  stroke and gallbladder_disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast_cancer 
Passage of mannitol into the brain around gliomas  a potential cause of rebound phenomenon.
AIM: Widespread use of mannitol to reduce brain_edema and lower elevated_ICP in brain_tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon.
As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of mannitol into the brain after administration to 21 brain_tumor patients.
METHODS: Mannitol (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant_glioma  seven brain metastases and four meningioma  about 30 minutes before craniotomy.
RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times).
In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of mannitol were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells.

Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid_arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac_sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II).
OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid_arthritis (RA .
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054).
The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI_AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)).
The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension related and oedema related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema .
CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI_AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg.
Placebo-level incidence of extrapyramidal_symptoms (EPS  with quetiapine in controlled studies of patients with bipolar_mania 
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate extrapyramidal_symptoms (EPS , including akathisia  with quetiapine in patients with bipolar_mania 
RESULTS: The incidence of EPS related adverse events, including akathisia  was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%).
Similarly, EPS related adverse events with QTP + Li DVP (21.4%) were no different than with PBO + Li DVP (19.2%).
Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with haloperidol (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS 
The incidence of akathisia was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li DVP (4.9%).
Lithium was associated with a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.05) of tremor (18.4%) than quetiapine (5.6%); cerebellar tremor  which is a known adverse effect of lithium  may have contributed to the elevated rate of tremor in patients receiving lithium therapy.
Haloperidol induced a significantly higher incidence (p < 0.001) of akathisia (33.3% versus 5.9%), tremor (30.3% versus 7.8%), and extrapyramidal_syndrome (35.4% versus 5.9%) than quetiapine 
Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt-sensitivity in lifetime captopril treated spontaneously hypertensive rats.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime captopril treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the hypertensive effect of dietary_sodium_chloride supplementation.
Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary_sodium_chloride induced increase_in_MAP in both groups.
Dose-related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary corticosterone on organophosphorus induced delayed neuropathy in chickens.
Although low concentrations (less than or equal to 50 ppm) of corticosterone had beneficial effects on TOTP induced neuropathy  greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either TOTP or DFP 
Neurotoxic esterase activities 24 hr after TOTP or DFP were less than 20% of values measured in chickens not given organophosphorous compounds.

Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial_infarction  stroke  hypertension and heart_failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase_inhibitors 
Predictors of decreased_renal_function in patients with heart_failure during angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of left_ventricular_dysfunction (SOLVD) BACKGROUND: Although angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive_heart_failure (CHF , it may also cause decreased_renal_function 
OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction_in_renal_function in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy.
METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of Left_Ventricular_Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF 
Decreased_renal_function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline.
We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine  low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension  diabetes  and use of antiplatelet, diuretic  and beta-blocker therapy.
RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased_renal_function than controls (P =.003).
By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased_renal_function  whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective.
Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased_renal_function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril  risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril  placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).
Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased_renal_function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66).
Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes 
CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased_renal_function in patients with CHF 
Pemoline induced acute choreoathetosis  case report and review of the literature.
BACKGROUND: Pemoline is an oxazolidine derivative that is structurally different from amphetamines and used in the treatment of attention_deficit_disorder 
Pemoline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement_disorders 
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with pemoline who experienced profound choreoathetosis 
The children had a medical history significant for attention_deficit_disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success.
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the choreoathetoid movements.
CONCLUSION: Pemoline associated movement_disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature.
Continuous subcutaneous administration of mesna to prevent ifosfamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis 
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mesna along with the cytotoxic agent.
In addition, subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mesna concentrations, such as in a patient taking oral mesna who experiences severe ifosfamide induced emesis and is unable to absorb the drug.
Pretreatment with ammonium_acetate (NH4Ac  (6 mmol/kg s.c.) approximately doubled the time morphine treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular incoordination by diazepam  but NH4Ac treatment alone had no effect.
Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium independent catecholamine release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac 
Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine analgesia  and diazepam induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol 
Risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast_media by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study.
Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast_media induced nephropathy (CIN  in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography.
This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast_media (CM , iopromide and iohexol  among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis 
Whereas 33.3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM  the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014).
A case of ventricular_tachycardia related to caffeine pretreatment.
Intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular_ectopy 
We describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac_disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of ventricular_tachycardia after caffeine administration.
Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with ethambutol induced optic_neuropathy 
PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal_degeneration in ethambutol induced optic_neuropathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT).
Ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis 
A serious complication of ethambutol is an optic_neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision.
METHODS: Three subjects with a history of ethambutol (EMB  induced optic_neuropathy of short-, intermediate-, and long-term visual_deficits were administered a full neuro-ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, and fundus examination.
In all subjects with history of EMB induced optic_neuropathy  there was a mean loss of 72% nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant (patient A, with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields, 58% loss; patient B, with intermediate visual_deficits  68% loss; patient C, with chronic visual_deficits  90% loss), with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26+/-16 microm.
CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with EMB induced optic_neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers.
Effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with arthritis 
We evaluated cardiovascular event data for valdecoxib  a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid_arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials.
The incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial thrombotic  was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid_arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration.
Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for valdecoxib  NSAIDs, and placebo.
The risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose.
Thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin (placebo, 1.4% vs. 0%; valdecoxib  1.7% vs. 0.2%; NSAIDs, 1.9% vs. 0.5%).
A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ephedrine for SSRI induced female sexual_dysfunction 
The objective of this study was to determine whether ephedrine  an alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women, has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant induced sexual_dysfunction 
Nineteen sexually_dysfunctional women receiving either fluoxetine  sertraline  or paroxetine participated in an eight-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of the effects of ephedrine (50 mg) on self-report measures of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction.
Potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist, A-86929  an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa primed monkeys.
The clinical utility of dopamine (DA  D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's_disease (PD  is still unclear.
We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP -exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of A-86929 ([-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+_++azacyclopent-1-_ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol , a selective and full DA D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action.
Acute administration of A-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY-171555  but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa 
A CD50 dose of local anesthetic (causing convulsions in 50% of mice) was fatal in 90% of bupivacaine induced seizures  in 57% of the chloroprocaine group, and in 6% of the lidocaine group.
Myoclonic  atonic, and absence seizures following institution of carbamazepine therapy in children.
Five children, aged 3 to 11 years, treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy  had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic, atypical absence and/or atonic (minor motor) seizures within a few days.
Naloxone reversal of hypotension due to captopril overdose 
The opioid antagonist naloxone has been shown to block or reverse the hypotensive actions of captopril 
We report a case of an intentional captopril overdose  manifested by marked hypotension  that resolved promptly with the administration of naloxone 
To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of captopril induced hypotension treated with naloxone 
Carbamazepine induced cardiac_dysfunction 
A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular_block  induced by carbamazepine  prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases.
From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of carbamazepine associated cardiac_dysfunction emerged.
One patient group developed sinus_tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose 
The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular_conduction_delay  associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels.
Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol induced catalepsy 
The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino_acid mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats.
Haloperidol induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA  20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl).
The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy  as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar.
Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's_disease 
Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's_disease (PD .
The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine_dihydrochloride (AMN082 , the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD 
Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol induced catalepsy in rats.
In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA lesioned rats.
In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice.
Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD 
Nimodipine prevents memory_impairment caused by nitroglycerin induced hypotension in adult mice.
We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO  administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG  induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory.
Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + NIMO  or delayed NTG (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect.
NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension 
Fatal haemopericardium and gastrointestinal_haemorrhage due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with warfarin 
We report a case of fatal internal haemorrhage in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of warfarin 
Isoproterenol induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts: correlation with myocardial_injury 
The mechanism of isoproterenol induced myocardial_damage is unknown, but a mismatch of oxygen supply vs. demand following coronary hypotension and myocardial_hyperactivity is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed.
High fat diet-fed obese rats are highly sensitive to doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity 
Often, chemotherapy by doxorubicin (Adriamycin  is limited due to life threatening cardiotoxicity in patients during and posttherapy.
Recently, we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity 
In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity 
A LD(10) dose (8 mg doxorubicin kg, ip) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher cardiotoxicity  cardiac_dysfunction  lipid peroxidation, and 80% mortality in the obese (OB  rats in the absence of any significant renal or hepatic toxicity.
Doxorubicin toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol (toxic metabolite) in the normal diet-fed (ND) and OB hearts.
Mechanistic studies revealed that OB rats are sensitized due to: (1) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3, (2) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-alpha, (3) decreased plasma adiponectin levels, (4) decreased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation (666.9+/-14.0 nmol/min/g heart in ND versus 400.2+/-11.8 nmol/min/g heart in OB , (5) decreased mitochondrial AMP alpha2 protein kinase, and (6) 86% drop in cardiac ATP levels accompanied by decreased ATP ADP ratio after doxorubicin administration.
Complete atrioventricular_block secondary to lithium therapy.
Sinus_node_dysfunction has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of lithium 
In the present case, complete atrioventricular_(AV)_block with syncopal_attacks developed secondary to lithium therapy, necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation.
Serum lithium levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the syncopal_attacks 
Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome induced by ziprasidone on the second day of treatment.
We describe a case of neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome (NMS  associated with the use of ziprasidone 
Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with NMS  atypical antipsychotic drugs like ziprasidone may also be a cause.
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who developed signs and symptoms of NMS after 2 days of treatment with an 80-mg/day dose of orally administrated ziprasidone 
Role of mangiferin on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in isoproterenol induced myocardial_infarction in rats.
(Anacardiaceae), on isoproterenol (ISPH  induced myocardial_infarction (MI  in rats through its antioxidative mechanism.
Subcutaneous injection of ISPH (200 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml saline) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused myocardial_damage in rat heart, which was determined by the increased activity of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes (CK-MB), increased uric_acid level and reduced plasma iron binding capacity.
The protective role of mangiferin was analyzed by triphenyl_tetrazolium_chloride (TTC  test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the ischemic_myocardium 
The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase and glutathione reductase activities, non-enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin, Vitamin_C  Vitamin_E and glutathione levels were altered in MI rats.
Upon pretreatment with mangiferin (100 mg/kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of dimethyl_sulphoxide  given intraperitoneally for 28 days to MI rats protected the above-mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels.
Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non-enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon mangiferin administration as compared to ISPH induced MI rats.
Remifentanil pretreatment reduces myoclonus after etomidate 
STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg/kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of myoclonus after anesthesia induction with etomidate 
MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of myoclonus was significantly lower in the remifentanil group (6.7%) than in the placebo group (70%) (P < 0.001).
In the placebo group, male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of myoclonus after etomidate administration.
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment with remifentanil 1 microg/kg reduced myoclonus after etomidate induction without side effects such as sedation, apnea  nausea  or pruritus 
Daidzein activates choline acetyltransferase from MC-IXC cells and improves drug induced amnesia 
The choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activator, which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of acetylcholine (ACh , is an important factor in the treatment of Alzheimer's_disease (AD .
In order to investigate the effects of daidzein from Pueraria thunbergiana on scopolamine induced impairments of learning and memory, we conducted a series of in vivo tests.
Administration of daidzein (4.5 mg/kg body weight) to mice was shown significantly to reverse scopolamine induced amnesia  according to the results of a Y-maze test.
Possible azithromycin associated hiccups 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of persistent hiccups associated by azithromycin therapy.
CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis 
Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups 
Corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone , benzodiazepines (midazolam  and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups 
Few cases of drug induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials.
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups 
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient.
Time trends in warfarin associated hemorrhage 
The annual incidence of warfarin related bleeding at Brigham and Women's Hospital increased from 0.97/1,000 patient admissions in the first time period (January 1995 to October 1998) to 1.19/1,000 patient admissions in the second time period (November 1998 to August 2002) of this study.
Fatal haemorrhagic myocarditis secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy.
Glyceryl_trinitrate induces attacks of migraine_without_aura in sufferers of migraine_with_aura 
In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric_oxide (NO  is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine_without_aura 
In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine_with_aura  in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl_trinitrate (GTN  (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine_with_aura 
Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008).
In the controls, the GTN induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion.
The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine_with_aura 
Stroke and cocaine or amphetamine use.
The association of cocaine and amphetamine use with hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke is based almost solely on data from case series.
The limited number of epidemiologic studies of stroke and use of cocaine and/or amphetamine have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and/or minorities.
The univariate matched odds ratio for stroke in women who admitted to using cocaine and/or amphetamine was 8.5 (95% confidence interval = 3.6-20.0).
Prevention of breast_cancer with tamoxifen  preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women.
BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast_cancer  although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial_cancer 
METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast_cancer and who had had a hysterectomy.
There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms.
There is a statistically significant reduction of breast_cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast_cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen 
Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular_events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen 
INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast_cancer  the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent.
A measure of pupillary_oscillation as a marker of cocaine induced paranoia 
Cocaine induced paranoia (CIP  remains an important drug induced model of idiopathic paranoia for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged.
Seizures induced by combined levomepromazine fluvoxamine treatment.
We report a case of combined levomepromazine fluvoxamine treatment induced seizures 
Why may epsilon-aminocaproic_acid (EACA  induce myopathy in man.
Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine 
Treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy.
Beta-2-adrenoceptor-mediated hypokalemia and its abolishment by oxprenolol 
The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline induced hypokalemia was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling.
Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such hypokalemia  together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs.
Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa 
Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord.
In spontaneously hypertensive  stroke prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT  injected intracerebroventricularly.
However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension 
Yohimbine treatment of sexual_side_effects induced by serotonin reuptake blockers.
BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male_impotence 
A single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual_side_effects of clomipramine 
This study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual_side_effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers.
METHOD: Six patients with either obsessive_compulsive_disorder  trichotillomania  anxiety  or affective_disorders who suffered sexual_side_effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p.r.n. basis in an open clinical trial.
Side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating, increased anxiety  and a wound-up feeling in some patients.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual_side_effects caused by serotonin reuptake blockers.
Hypersensitivity immune reaction as a mechanism for dilevalol associated hepatitis 
OBJECTIVE: To assess lymphocyte reactivity to dilevalol and to serum containing putative ex vivo dilevalol antigens or metabolites in a case of dilevalol induced liver_injury 
PATIENT: A 58-year-old woman with a clinical diagnosis of dilevalol induced liver_injury 
Reversible myocardial_hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report.
Herein we describe transient myocardial_hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation.
Myocardial_hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy.
Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial_hypertrophy 
Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa induced dyskinesias were selected.
Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left homonymous_hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day.
Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin_aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats.
We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephrosis  which is an experimental model of human nephrotic_syndrome 
Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin_aminonucleoside induced hematological_abnormalities 
Puromycin_aminonucleoside induced renal_dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed.
These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephrotic_syndrome 
Reverse or inverted left_ventricular_apical_ballooning_syndrome (reverse Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy  in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use.
Amphetamine induced locomotor_hyperactivity was similar in all groups.
Peripheral iron_dextran induced degeneration_of_dopaminergic_neurons in rat substantia nigra.
Iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's_disease 
To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra (SN), in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, Perls' iron staining, and high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection to study the degeneration_of_dopaminergic_neurons and increased iron content in the SN of iron_dextran overloaded animals.
These results suggest that peripheral iron_dextran can increase the iron level in the SN, where excessive iron causes the degeneration_of_dopaminergic_neurons 
Warfarin induced leukocytoclastic_vasculitis 
We report 4 patients with late-onset LV probably due to warfarin 
All 4 patients presented with skin_eruptions that developed after receiving warfarin for several years.
The results of skin_lesion biopsies were available in 3 patients, confirming LV_Cutaneous_lesions resolved in all patients after warfarin was discontinued.
The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal_cord_ischemia 
We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA  receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic_occlusion in rats.
Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine induced spastic_paraparesis 
IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine induced spastic_paraparesis compared with the saline group.
These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic_paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate  which is involved in NMDA receptor activation.
Reduced sodium channel density, altered voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased susceptibility to seizures in mice lacking sodium channel beta 2-subunits.
In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Na v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures  as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine induced seizures  but seemed normal in other neurological tests.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients.
Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult seizure patients had a low yield.
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian 'off' signs and levodopa induced dyskinesias (LID .
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID 
The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias 
Pain responses in methadone maintained opioid abusers.
This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid_addicts stabilized in methadone maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60).
By using a placebo-controlled, two-way factorial design, tolerance to cold-pressor (CP) pain was examined, both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid (hydromorphone 2 mg) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (ketorolac 10 mg) analgesic agents.
METHODS: Puromycin_aminonucleoside (PAN  was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria 
Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen induced rat pituitary_tumors may mediate estrogen initiated tumor angiogenesis.
Estrogens  which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers  can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats.
The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis  are still unknown.
To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis.
The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats.
Pravastatin associated myopathy 
A case of acute inflammatory_myopathy associated with the use of pravastatin  a new hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is reported.
He assumed pravastatin (20 mg/day) because of hypercholesterolemia 
He was admitted with acute myopathy of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after pravastatin discontinuation.
Dose-effect and structure-function relationships in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy 
The cardiomyopathy (CM  produced by the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DXR  (Adriamycin  provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose-effect and structure-function relationships during development of myocardial_disease 
Fatal aplastic_anemia following topical administration of ophthalmic chloramphenicol 
A 73-year-old woman died of aplastic_anemia less than two months after undergoing cataract extraction and beginning topical therapy with chloramphenicol 
The pattern of the aplastic_anemia was associated with an idiosyncratic response to chloramphenicol 
This was the second report of fatal aplastic_anemia after topical treatment with chloramphenicol for ocular conditions, although two cases of reversible bone_marrow_hypoplasia have also been reported.
Bradycardia due to trihexyphenidyl_hydrochloride 
A chronic schizophrenic patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug, trihexyphenidyl_hydrochloride 
Experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity  risk of concomitant chemotherapy.
The role of cyclosporine (CSA  alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal_toxicity was evaluated in rats.
The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin (at therapeutic doses), amphothericin_B and ketoconazole  which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model.
Gentamicin at toxic doses, however, increased CSA nephrotoxicity 
Receptor mechanisms of nicotine induced locomotor_hyperactivity in chronic nicotine treated rats.
Hydrocortisone induced hypertension in humans: pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function.
Although suprofen has been associated with the development of acute_renal_failure in greater than 100 subjects, the mechanism of damage remains unclear.
The direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of suprofen were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell-free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg/dL of uric_acid 
Cocaine induced brainstem seizures and behavior.
Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of deoxycholic_acid in ethinyl_estradiol induced cholestasis in rats.
Effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary_artery_disease 
The effects of digitalis_glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary_artery_disease  but have not been measured previously in man.
We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary_artery_disease without clinical congestive_heart_failure 
We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary_artery_disease who are not in clinical congestive_heart_failure left_ventricular_end-diastolic_volume_falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal.
Prolongation_of_the_QT_interval related to cisapride diltiazem interaction.
Cisapride  a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal_motility_disorders 
Prolongation_of_QT_interval  torsades_de_pointes  and sudden_cardiac_death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents, but not with other CYP3A4 inhibitors.
A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal_reflux_disorder and diltiazem  an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension 
Paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian_cancer 
In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (Taxol  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian_cancer  paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2.
Relative efficacy and toxicity of netilmicin and tobramycin in oncology patients.
We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin_sulfate or tobramycin_sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin_sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections 
Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin (17% vs 11%).
Ototoxicity occurred in four (9.5%) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 (22%) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin treated patients.
Effect of prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced convulsions in rats.
To investigate the relationship of prostaglandins (PGs  to seizure induction, the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on convulsions induced by flurothyl  picrotoxin  pentetrazol (PTZ , electroshock or bicuculline were evaluated.
This is a case report on a 45-year old African-American female with newly diagnosed hypertension  who was started on a combination pill of amlodipine benazapril 10/5 mg.
Valproic_acid I: time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers, liver_toxicity  and valproic_acid metabolite levels in rats.
To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between VPA associated oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity  adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated ip with VPA (500 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline (vehicle) once daily for 2, 4, 7, 10, or 14 days.
Liver_toxicity was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and by histology.
Pheochromocytoma unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride 
OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of pheochromocytoma in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride 
CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg.
DISCUSSION: Drug induced symptoms of pheochromocytoma are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown.
In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and tiapride therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride  and tiapride induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with pheochromocytoma 
Quantitative drug levels in stimulant psychosis  relationship to symptom severity, catecholamines and hyperkinesia 
To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels, catecholamines  and psychotic_symptoms  nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of amphetamine  or cocaine induced psychosis were interviewed, and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels.
Methamphetamine or amphetamine levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating.
Delayed asystolic cardiac_arrest after diltiazem overdose  resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium 
A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem  paracetamol  aspirin  isosorbide nitrate  and alcohol 
This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose  particularly with the onset of asystole 
It should be considered early in cases of cardiac_arrest after diltiazem overdose 
Renal_papillary_necrosis due to naproxen 
A 31-year-old man with rheumatoid_arthritis  who had previously been treated with sulindac  fenoprofen_calcium  high dose salicylates and gold salts, developed renal_papillary_necrosis (RPN  4 months after institution of naproxen therapy.
Three patients with ischaemic_heart_disease developed profound cardiac_failure  hypotension and bradycardia during combined therapy with verapamil and beta-adrenergic_blocking_drugs 
Adverse reactions to bendrofluazide and propranolol for the treatment of mild hypertension 
Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild hypertension are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups: bendrofluazide  propranolol  or a placebo for either of these drugs.
The results show an association between bendrofluazide treatment and impotence  and impotence also occurred more frequently in patients taking propranolol than in those taking placebos.
Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include impaired_glucose_tolerance in men and women and gout in men, associated with bendrofluazide treatment, and Raynaud's_phenomenon and dyspnoea in men and women taking propranolol 
No corneal_disease is known to have occurred in the propranolol group.
Dexmedetomidine was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes; all-cause mortality (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.01-7.13, p = 0.44), non-fatal myocardial_infarction (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04-1.60, p = 0.14), and myocardial_ischaemia (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26-1.63, p = 0.36).
Differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic_lupus_erythematosus 
We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine induced myopathy 
Since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic_lupus_erythematosus (SLE  with renal_involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide 
Additional therapy with chloroquine (CQ  was started because of arthralgia 
Myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids 
As it revealed chloroquine induced myopathy  medication was stopped.
Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus_disease in immunocompromised children.
Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory_syncytial_virus_infection  and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis_C 
Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection_with_hemorrhagic_fever_viruses 
The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia 
The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus_infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity 
OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus_disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature.
DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus_disease 
Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive_renal_failure and neutropenia 
Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus_disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection 
CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus_disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered.
Hepatotoxicity of amiodarone 
Amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachyarrhythmias 
A patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is given.
It is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic_injury due to amiodarone treatment, including steatosis  alterations resembling alcoholic_hepatitis  cholestatic hepatitis and micronodular cirrhosis_of_the_liver 
Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine  potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat.
Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat.
Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine  whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain.
Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination.
Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects.
Acute_renal_failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis 
Renal_failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir_disoproxil_fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen.
Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi_syndrome and renal_insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule.
Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent.
BACKGROUND: A transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular_accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy, most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leukaemia 
RESULTS: We identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate (intrathecal, systemic), 5-fluorouracil and its derivative carmofur  and capecitabine 
Down-regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local-anesthetics induced convulsions and the counteraction by co-administration with local anesthetics.
Alterations of norepinephrine transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice.
Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine induced convulsions 
Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine 
These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions 
The current best treatment for HCV_infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin 
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin induced hemolysis  and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV_infection  especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders.
Although ribavirin associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates.
Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.
Calcium_carbonate toxicity  the updated milk-alkali_syndrome  report of 3 cases and review of the literature.
OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with calcium_carbonate induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk-alkali_syndrome 
METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg/dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk-alkali_syndrome 
RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute_renal_insufficiency  relative metabolic_alkalosis  and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin_D concentrations.
The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia 
CONCLUSION: Milk-alkali_syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium_carbonate in susceptible persons.
Management strategies for ribavirin induced hemolytic_anemia in the treatment of hepatitis_C  clinical and economic implications.
OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/ribavirin compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic_hepatitis_C (CHC .
Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin induced hemolytic_anemia (RIHA .
The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage.
Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real-world population.
Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine catatonia in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals.
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine induced catatonia in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat.
In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of catatonia (DOC) after ketamine  but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not.
Multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups efficacy and safety trial of azelastine  chlorpheniramine  and placebo in the treatment of spring_allergic_rhinitis 
Azelastine  a novel antiallergic medication, was compared with chlorpheniramine_maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring_allergic_rhinitis in a multicenter, double-blind, multiple-dose, parallel-groups study.
Drowsiness and altered_taste_perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high-dose azelastine group.
Prolonged paralysis due to nondepolarizing_neuromuscular_blocking_agents and corticosteroids 
The long-term use of nondepolarizing_neuromuscular_blocking_agents (ND-NMBA  has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle_weakness  although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear.
We report 3 patients (age 37-52 years) with acute respiratory_insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of ND-NMBAs 
The weakness in these patients is due to pathology_at_both_the_neuromuscular_junction (most likely due to ND-NMBA  and muscle (most likely due to corticosteroids .
Prostaglandin_E2 induced bladder_hyperactivity in normal, conscious rats: involvement of tachykinins 
Thiazide diuretics, hypokalemia and cardiac_arrhythmias 
Hypokalemia is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic thiazide therapy.
We treated 38 patients (22 low renin, 16 normal renin) with moderate diastolic_hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTC  administered on a twice daily schedule.
In conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body potassium 
Diuretics, potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary_disease 
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac_arrhythmias 
Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary_artery_disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium conserving diuretic (amiloride  and a similar period on a potassium losing diuretic (chlorthalidone  in a randomised study.
Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular_ectopic_beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation.
GABA involvement in naloxone induced reversal of respiratory_paralysis produced by thiopental 
In this study naloxone reversed respiratory_paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA  decreased glutamate  and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem.
Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental  50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory_arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino_acids studied in four regions of rat brain.
Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory_paralysis  glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum.
These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis_B immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis_B_vaccine 
The effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic_acid writhing tests.
Prostaglandin_D2 (0.5-3 ng/mouse) had a hyperalgesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3-60 min period after injection.
Prostaglandin_E2 showed a hyperalgesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng/mouse, but the effect lasted shorter (3-30 min) than that of prostaglandin_D2 
The hyperalgesic effect of prostaglandin_D2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist (greater than or equal to 100 ng) but not by AH6809  a prostanoid EP1-receptor antagonist.
Conversely, prostaglandin_E2 induced hyperalgesia was blocked by AH6809 (greater than or equal to 500 ng) but not by the substance P antagonist.
Prostaglandin_F2_alpha had little effect on pain responses.
Swallowing induced atrial_tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol  case report and review of the literature.
The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol  but recurred a year later.
After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol  the arrhythmia disappeared.
CONCLUSION: Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT 
Coenzyme_Q10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mice.
The nephroprotective effect of coenzyme_Q10 was investigated in mice with acute_renal_injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg).
Coenzyme_Q10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms (reduced_glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity), suppressed lipid peroxidation, decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric_oxide and platinum ion concentration, and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administration.
Also, histopathological renal_tissue_damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme_Q10 treatment.
Metformin prevents experimental gentamicin induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway.
The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular_dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients.
Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity 
Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin mediated acute_renal_failure 
These in vivo markers of kidney_dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients (>or=65 years) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip_fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sedation.
CONCLUSION: The use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50% compared with deep sedation.
Sorafenib induced acute myocardial_infarction due to coronary_artery_spasm 
Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable_angina status.
We report the first case of sorafenib induced coronary_artery_spasm 
RESULTS: The results indicate that ciprofloxacin  and norfloxacin treated rats showed anxious_behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied.
Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT induced cardiomyopathy 
METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine  AZT  triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM  8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml).
In contrast, AZT treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac_dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles.
Valproate induced chorea and encephalopathy in atypical nonketotic_hyperglycinemia 
Nonketotic_hyperglycinemia is a disorder_of_amino_acid_metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartments.
Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine induced amnesia in adult male rats.
The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist) induced amnesia in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated.
With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephrotic_syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model.
Expression of the hypoxia responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin_aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes.
However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart_damage  for example, systemic_sclerosis patients.
Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric_oxide (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam and theophylline  vasodilators.
Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline  was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric_oxide synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1).
Topiramate induced nephrolithiasis 
Topiramate is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating refractory_seizures 
These factors can lead to the development of calcium_phosphate nephrolithiasis 
Spironolactone  is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin_B related hypokalemia in cancer patients.
OBJECTIVE: Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin_B (AmB , often limiting administration of full dosage.
Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB 
Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB 
This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.
METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological_disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal_infection 
Dopamine (DA , through D1/D2 receptor-mediated signaling, plays a major role in the control of epileptic_seizures arising in the limbic system.
In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy induced neuronal cell death.
Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine 
However, pilocarpine induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to KA 
Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine 
Treatment of risperidone induced hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist in children.
BACKGROUND: Risperidone  a potent antagonist of both serotonergic (5HT2A) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children.
We report the successful treatment of risperidone induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with risperidone induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline 
RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental_Disorders (fourth edition) bipolar_disorder or psychoses  with risperidone induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng/mL, normal 5-15 ng/mL), were treated with cabergoline (mean dose 2.13 +/- 0.09 mg/week).
Cholestatic_jaundice associated with the use of metformin 
We report a patient who developed cholestatic_jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin_hydrochloride 
Metformin_hydrochloride was discontinued, and the patient's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months.
Electro-oculography, electroretinography, visual evoked potentials, and multifocal electroretinography in patients with vigabatrin attributed visual_field_constriction 
PURPOSE: Symptomatic visual_field_constriction thought to be associated with vigabatrin has been reported.
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known vigabatrin attributed visual_field_loss  three of whom were reported previously.
CONCLUSION: Marked visual_field_constriction appears to be associated with vigabatrin therapy.
BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA  or tacrolimus (Tac  toxicity 
The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial_dysmorphism (2), posttransplant_lymphoproliferative_disorder (PTLD  in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1.
RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months].
RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous_ulcers in one.
Worsening of levodopa induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks.
Ten patients who had Parkinson's_disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine 
Structural_and_functional_impairment_of_mitochondria in adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy in mice: suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression.
The use of adriamycin (ADR  in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular_toxicity 
Our results indicated that 1) treatment of mice with ADR caused cardiovascular_arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia  extension of ventricular depolarization time (tQRS), and failure of QRS at high concentrations (10-14 mg/kg body weight cumulative dose); 2) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling  fusion, dissolution, and/or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment.
Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid 
High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia  an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric_acid (GABA .
In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose urethane 
Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol  pindolol  labetalol and atenolol  as well as after clonidine  but not after hexamethonium or carbachol 
Epileptogenic activity of folic_acid after drug induces SLE (folic_acid and epilepsy  OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic_acid containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth_defects and epilepsy related side effects.
RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic_acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy related side effects during the periconception period.
This 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic_acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation.
CONCLUSIONS: The epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune_disease (probably drug induced lupus  could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic_acid triggered a cluster of seizures 
Effects of cisapride on symptoms and postcibal small-bowel motor function in patients with irritable_bowel_syndrome 
Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, cisapride  on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable_bowel_syndrome (IBS .
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [cisapride  5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)].
RESULTS: In diarrhoea predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the cisapride and placebo groups.
In cisapride treated diarrhoea predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo.
Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in cisapride treated constipation predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm].
Diarrhoea predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after cisapride therapy [score, 55 +/- 15 versus 34 +/- 12 mm, cisapride versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +/- 19 mm].
Clarithromycin induced ventricular_tachycardia 
Although the side-effect profile of erythromycin is established, including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed-function oxidase metabolism, experience with the newer macrolides is still being recorded.
Cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macrolides 
We report a case of ventricular_dysrhythmias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of clarithromycin 
Persistent nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus following lithium therapy.
Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium induced nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus  and lithium therapy had been discontinued.
He remained thirsty and polyuric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and vasopressin secretion, with clear evidence of nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus 
Lithium induced nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but polyuria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stopped.
Cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant bone_tumors who were treated according to Rosen's_T5_or_T10_protocol  both including doxorubicin 
The incidence of doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow-up, irrespective of cumulative dose.
Venous_complications of midazolam versus diazepam 
Although some studies have suggested fewer venous_complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures, this variable has not been well documented.
We prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous_complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
Overall, venous_complications were more frequent with diazepam (22 of 62 patients) than with midazolam (4 of 60 patients) (p < 0.001).
Pain at the injection site occurred in 35% (22 of 62) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7% (4 of 60 patients) in the midazolam group (p < 0.001).
Tetany and rhabdomyolysis due to surreptitious furosemide -importance of magnesium supplementation.
While severe hypokalemia may cause muscle_weakness  severe hypomagnesemia is associated with muscle_spasms and tetany which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone (1,2).
Loss of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA-containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following pilocarpine induced seizures 
In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic_acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA-containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure induced damage in a model of chronic seizures 
Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine  and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1, 2, 4, and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine induced seizures 
Additional neuronanatomical studies, including cresyl_violet staining, neuronal_degeneration methods, and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA-containing neurons was related to neuronal_loss rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels.
Protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal_dysfunction in elderly patients.
CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal_dysfunction 
Nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation.
Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of propranolol and pindolol inhibiting the ouabain arrhythmia in dogs and cats.
Chorea associated with oral_contraception 
Three patients developed chorea while receiving oral_contraceptives 
The third patient had acute amphetamine induced chorea after prolonged oral_contraception 
Reversal of ammonia coma in rats by L-dopa  a peripheral effect.
Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL 
This coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol L-dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium_salt injection.
Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations.
Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented.
Thus, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L-dopa  can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation.
BACKGROUND: Unfractionated_heparin_sodium (UFH  or low-molecular_weight_heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT  is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin  resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%.
The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown.
The heparin induced platelet_aggregation test was negative in these patients.
None of the subjects/patients developed UFH related HIT 
PTU associated vasculitis in a girl with Turner_Syndrome and Graves'_disease 
The diagnosis of propylthiouracil (PTU -associated vasculitis was made by observation of consistent clinical features, the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood, and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of PTU 
Succinylcholine induced masseter_muscle_rigidity during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
Here, we describe a case of severe masseter_muscle_rigidity (jaw_of_steel  after succinylcholine (Sch  administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body.
Minor neurological_dysfunction  cognitive development, and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after dexamethasone treatment in very-low birth-weight infants.
The objective of this study was to assess minor neurological_dysfunction  cognitive development, and somatic development after dexamethasone therapy in very-low-birthweight infants.
After dexamethasone treatment, children showed a higher rate of minor neurological_dysfunctions 
Force overflow and levodopa induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's_disease 
We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson's_disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy, particularly to levodopa induced dyskinesias (LID .
We studied two groups of Parkinson's_disease patients with (Parkinson's_disease + LID  n = 23) and without levodopa induced dyskinesias (Parkinson's_disease - LID  n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls.
The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's_Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa 
In Parkinson's_disease + LID  the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, P < 0.05).
Postinfarction ventricular_septal_defect associated with long-term steroid therapy.
Two cases of postinfarction ventricular_septal_rupture in patients on long-term steroid therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described.
Angioedema associated with droperidol administration.
Clarithromycin associated visual_hallucinations in a patient with chronic_renal_failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
Unreported in the literature is visual_hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic, clarithromycin 
The combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic_renal_failure in a functionally anephric patient, with underlying aluminum intoxication, may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effect.
Acute renal_toxicity of doxorubicin (adriamycin -loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles.
Acute doxorubicin loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal_toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis 
A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX 
In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis  5/6 rats given DX died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by DXNP, NP, or untreated, which all survived.
Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX 
These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, DXNP killed less animals than free DX  despite of an enhanced renal_toxicity of the former.
Etoposide related myocardial_infarction 
Subjective assessment of sexual_dysfunction of patients on long-term administration of digoxin 
The patients of the study and control group (without digoxin  were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic_heart_disease patients.
Fatal aplastic_anemia due to indomethacin -lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro.
Although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic_anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations, its role has not been definitely established.
A case of fatal aplastic_anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were given.
Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic_syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin_aminonucleoside 
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic_syndrome induced by puromycin_aminonucleoside were due to nephrotic_syndrome per se, or, at least in part, to the aminonucleoside 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin_aminonucleoside (20 mg/kg for 7 days) and the subsequent development of nephrotic_syndrome 
In pre-nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty_acids  triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl_esters and HDL remained constant.
Acid protease (cathepsin D) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant_hepatic_failure after paracetamol overdose  whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant_hepatic_failure due to viral_hepatitis whether or not they survived.
Transketolase abnormality in tolazamide induced Wernicke's_encephalopathy 
We studied a thiamine dependent enzyme, transketolase, from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed Wernicke's_encephalopathy when treated with tolazamide  in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [high Km for thiamine_pyrophosphate (TPP ], as previously reported in postalcoholic Wernicke-Korsakoff_syndrome 
We found that the above-mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kindreds with no history of Wernicke's_encephalopathy had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for TPP 
Mechanisms of myocardial_ischemia induced by epinephrine  comparison with exercise induced ischemia 
The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial_ischemia was examined in patients with coronary_artery_disease 
Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise.
Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial_ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina 
However, the mechanisms of myocardial_ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise.
Exercise induced myocardial_ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product.
Transient contralateral_rotation following unilateral substantia_nigra_lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine 
Following unilateral 6-OHDA induced SN_lesion  a transient period of contralateral_rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral_circling 
In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral_rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine induced rotational_behavior 
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral_rotation 
However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections.
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic_diabetes_insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment.
Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium 
Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in azidothymidine treated immunodeficient mice.
The anaemia induced by 3'-azido-3'dideoxythymidine (AZT  is poorly understood.
We have used a murine model of AIDS  infection of female C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukaemia (MuLV) virus, to determine if AZT induced anaemia is due, in part, to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors (BFU-e) to erythropoietin (EPO).
AZT produced anaemia in both groups, in a dose-dependent fashion.
Despite the anaemia  the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU-e in AZT treated mice increased up to five-fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment.
The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in AZT treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenylhydrazine (PHZ  treated mice.
The numbers of BFU-e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in AZT and PHZ treated mice with similar degrees of anaemia 
However, reticulocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in AZT treated infected mice.
Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy with iodine-125-metaiodobenzylguanidine 
Using a rat model of adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy  we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy 
The degree of vacuolar_degeneration_of_myocardial_cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week).
Amnestic_syndrome associated with propranolol toxicity  a case report.
An elderly woman developed an Alzheimer like subacute dementia as a result of propranolol toxicity 
Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action.
Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine induced tachycardia  while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery.
The use of serum cholinesterase in succinylcholine apnoea 
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succinylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase.
Orthostatic_hypotension occurs following alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade in chronic prazosin pretreated conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. 1.
Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2.
However, the head-up tilt induced orthostatic_hypotension in the SHR treated with prazosin (-16% MAP, n = 6), but not in the SHR treated with rauwolscine (less than +2% MAP, n = 6). 3.
Head-up tilts in these rats did not produce orthostatic_hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.).
The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic prazosin pretreatment.
Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4).
On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treatment.
A forty-six year-old premenopausal woman developed headache  nausea and vomiting  left hemiparesis and seizure two days after parenteral use of progesterone and estradiol 
Chloroquine related complete heart_block with blindness  case report.
A 27-year old African woman with history of regular chloroquine ingestion presented with progressive deterioration_of_vision  easy fatiguability  dyspnoea  dizziness progressing to syncopal_attacks 
Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of chloroquine retinopathy  cardiac assessment revealed features of heart_failure and a complete heart_block with right_bundle_branch_block pattern.
The heart_block was treated by pacemaker insertion and the heart_failure resolved spontaneously following chloroquine discontinuation.
Systemic toxicity and resuscitation in bupivacaine , levobupivacaine , or ropivacaine infused rats.
We compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine  levobupivacaine  and ropivacaine in anesthetized rats.
The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bupivacaine 
The cumulative doses of levobupivacaine that produced dysrhythmias and asystole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine  but they were larger than those of bupivacaine 
22-oxacalcitriol suppresses secondary_hyperparathyroidism without inducing low_bone_turnover in dogs with renal_failure 
BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with renal_failure but has several drawbacks, including hypercalcemia and/or marked suppression_of_bone_turnover  which may lead to adynamic_bone_disease 
This study was undertaken to determine the effects of OCT on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired_renal_function 
RESULTS: In Nx dogs, OCT significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal_insufficiency 
In long-standing secondary_hyperparathyroidism  OCT (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months.
In Nx dogs, OCT reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven_osteoid and fibrosis  but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover.
Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non-small_cell_lung_cancer with paclitaxel  a phase II trial.
Paclitaxel (Taxol  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma.
Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small_cell_lung_cancer (NSCLC  reported response rates of 21% and 24%.
We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC 
Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity 
Cerebral_hemorrhage associated with phenylpropanolamine in combination with caffeine 
Phenylpropanolamine (PPA  is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke 
In order to determine if PPA caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and/or hypertensive rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days.
A single PPA caffeine administration (same dose) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals.
Long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular_tachycardia or ventricular_fibrillation 
Amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular_tachycardia (VT  (n = 118) or a cardiac_arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.
Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular_fibrillation (VF  over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2).
Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug.
Although large-dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients.
Effect of calcium_chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats.
This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant induced hypotension 
METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose 
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension  QRS prolongation, and bradycardia 
RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation.
The incidence of ventricular_arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups.
CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant induced hypotension in rats.
CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity.
Phase I trial of 13-cis-retinoic_acid in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation.
PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13-cis-retinoic_acid (cis-RA  can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation.
Since cis-RA has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy.
This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), toxicities  and pharmacokinetics of cis-RA administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
All toxicities resolved after cis-RA was discontinued.
The DLT included hypercalcemia  and may be predicted by serum cis-RA levels.
The effect of calcium_chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis  tremor and clonic-tonic_convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated.
On the other hand, mydriasis  tremor and clonic-tonic_convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium_chloride 
It is apparent that calcium_chloride can "dissociate" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis  tremor and clonic-tonic_convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine 
Multiple side effects of penicillamine therapy in one patient with rheumatoid_arthritis 
Skin_rashes  proteinuria  systemic_lupus_erythematosus  polymyositis and myasthenia_gravis have all been recorded as complications of penicillamine therapy in patients with rheumatoid_arthritis 
Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine  appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular_tachycardia  one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman.
Supraventricular_tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine .
Aventyl (nortriptyline  and Elavil (amitriptyline  each produced left_bundle_branch_block in a 73 year old woman.
The ventricular_arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one.
Serotonergic drugs, benzodiazepines and baclofen block muscimol induced myoclonic_jerks in a strain of mice.
In male Swiss mice, muscimol produced myoclonic_jerks 
Of the benzodiazepines  clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the myoclonic_jerks 
Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus  the muscimol induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition.
Following short exposure to oral prednisone  both boys developed lethargy  increasing somnolence  polydipsia  polyphagia  and polyuria 
Nonketotic lactic_acidosis was present in one and ketosis without a known serum lactate level was present in the other.
Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., crocin on streptozocin induced model of sporadic Alzheimer's_disease in male rats.
In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's_disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ  in male rats was investigated.
In Alzheimer's_disease groups, rats were injected with STZ icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ icv application was repeated.
In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ injected group in passive avoidance test.
Rosaceiform dermatitis associated with topical tacrolimus treatment.
We describe herein 3 patients who developed rosacea like dermatitis eruptions while using 0.03% or 0.1% tacrolimus ointment for facial_dermatitis 
Tacrine  administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal_damage 
All the animals treated with tacrine loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively).
In addition, tacrine loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage_of_neuronal_cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals.
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of pilocarpine and explore the underlying ionic mechanism, using both aconitine induced rat and ouabain induced guinea pig arrhythmia models.
The current data showed that pilocarpine significantly delayed onset of arrhythmias  decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, reduced arrhythmia score, and increased the survival time of arrhythmic rats and guinea pigs. [Ca 2+)](i) overload induced by aconitine or ouabain was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with pilocarpine 
These data suggest that pilocarpine produced antiarrhythmic actions on arrhythmic rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR.
Disulfiram induced transient optic and peripheral neuropathy: a case report.
AIM: To report a case of optic and peripheral neuropathy after chronic use of disulfiram for alcohol_dependence management.
He had been taking disulfiram for alcohol_dependence for the preceding 3 years.
Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis_B virus-related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy.
Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate induced narcosis in rats.
Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug induced narcosis 
Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis  however, no dose-effect correlation was found.
In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis 
In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis  and a reduction in mortality rate.
Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine  or diazepam induced narcosis 
Effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine induced amnesia 
The effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase, scopolamine induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well-known cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and E-2020 
All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task.
These findings suggest that NIK-247 at a low dose (0.1-1 mg/kg p.o.) improves scopolamine induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous movement.
Nightmares and hallucinations after long-term intake of tramadol combined with antidepressants.
Tramadol is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat cancer pain and chronic non malignant pain 
This drug was initiated in association with paroxetine and dosulepine_hydrochloride in a tetraparetic patient with chronic_pain 
Fifty-six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented hallucinations that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho-active drugs and tramadol 
BMT was used to treat severe aplastic_anemia which was caused by gold in one case and D-penicillamine in the other.
Acute_experimental_models_of_renal_damage to the proximal tubular, glomerular, and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hexachloro-1:3-butadiene (HCBD , puromycin_aminonucleoside (PAN , and 2-bromoethylamine (BEA , respectively.
Tubular damage produced by HCBD or BEA was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular_damage produced by PAN 
Neuromuscular_blockade with magnesium_sulfate and nifedipine 
A patient who received tocolysis with nifedipine developed neuromuscular_blockade after 500 mg of magnesium_sulfate was administered.
The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria 
Myocardial_infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene_citrate for ovulation induction: a case report.
Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC 
CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest_pain 
CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial_infarction 
Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long-term phenobarbital therapy: an autopsy report of two patients.
Phenobarbital (PB  has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver_disease 
Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with PB who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac_arrest  the other of acute bronchopneumonia 
Our findings illustrate that PB may be associated with chronic liver_damage  which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences.
Ethambutol associated optic_neuropathy 
INTRODUCTION: Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis  which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual_loss 
CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with ethambutol associated toxic optic_neuropathy are described.
CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual_loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up.
Tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients with NSAID induced urticaria angioedema 
In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nimesulide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well-documented history of NSAID induced urticaria angioedema 
A single-placebo-controlled oral challenge procedure with nimesulide or paracetamol was applied to 829 patients with a history of NSAID induced urticaria angioedema 
Furthermore, 18.28% of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11.8% of subjects with an history of NSAID induced urticaria angioedema or angioedema alone (with or without chronic urticaria  resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs.
Taken together, our results confirm the good tolerability of nimesulide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria angioedema caused by NSAIDs 
Effects of verapamil on atrial_fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs.
BACKGROUND: Atrial_tachycardia induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial_fibrillation (AF  and decreases L-type Ca 2+) current.
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca 2) channel blockade can promote AF  consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca 2+) channel inhibition.
METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca 2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine chloralose anesthetized dogs.
RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.
In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005).
Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5).
In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness.
Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle.
Hypotension  bradycardia  and asystole after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient.
We report a case of hypotension  bradycardia  and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode.
This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden_death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP .
Lifetime treatment of mice with azidothymidine (AZT  produces myelodysplasia 
AZT has induced a macrocytic_anemia in AIDS patients on long term AZT therapy.
Influence of diet free of NAD precursors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mice.
Recently, we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic_acid_amide  a selective inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; EC 2.4.2.30) on mice suffering from acetaminophen (AAP -hepatitis  suggesting that the AAP induced liver_injury involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation.
The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD  the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with AAP hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals.
Liver_injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT).
In these animals, only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of AAP  and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet, the liver_damage was inhibited by 50% by ethanol 
A further 64% reduction of hepatitis was observed, when NAA was given to ethanol AAP mice.
Our results provide evidence that the AAP induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end-product inhibition of PARP by NAA or by dietary depletion of the enzyme's substrate NAD 
Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of cibenzoline on canine ventricular_arrhythmias 
Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis , and adrenaline induced canine ventricular_arrhythmias  antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined.
Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias  and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis  and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7).
The concentration for adrenaline induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias

Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after cocaine associated subarachnoid_hemorrhage 
INTRODUCTION: Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular_complications  including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis 
Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine associated subarachnoid_hemorrhage (SAH  who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use.
METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites.
The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell gastric_lymphoma and myotonic_dystrophy  the most common form of adult muscular_dystrophy  and sudden atrial_fibrillation following one cycle of doxorubicin based chemotherapy in the same patient.
A phase II study of thalidomide in advanced metastatic renal_cell_carcinoma 
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the toxicity and activity of thalidomide in patients with advanced metastatic renal_cell_cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, with therapy.
CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal_cell_carcinoma 
Haloperidol (1 mg/kg ip) induced parkinsonian like muscle_rigidity  measured as an increased resistance of a rat's hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint.

Acute cholestatic hepatitis after exposure to isoflurane 
OBJECTIVE: To report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic isoflurane 
No other medications were involved except for dipyrone for analgesia 
Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during nitric_oxide induced headache in patients with chronic tension-type_headache 
It has been proposed that nitric_oxide (NO  induced headache in primary_headaches may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor glyceryl_trinitrate (GTN  in 16 patients with chronic tension-type_headache and 16 healthy controls.
The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min GTN or placebo over 20 min on two headache free days.
Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the GTN day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls.
Myocardial_ischemia due to coronary_artery_spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography.
Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial_ischemia 
The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial_ischemia due to coronary_spasm is induced by dobutamine 
Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine  and no fixed coronary_artery_stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients.
These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary_spasm in some patients with coronary_spastic_angina 
Nitric_oxide synthase expression in the course of lead induced hypertension 
We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead induced hypertension 
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression.
Vitamin_E supplementation ameliorated hypertension  lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression.
In conclusion, lead induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression.
Risk for valvular_heart_disease among users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before use of medication.
BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular_disease  these drugs were withdrawn from the market.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular_abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications.
RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving fenfluramine phentermine developed valvular_heart_disease 
BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin s advantages (CBDCA  over cisplatin (CDDP  is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects.
However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral_nervous_system_damage 
RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent peripheral_neurotoxicity 
CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.
Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast_cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast_cancer  its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined.
We have investigated the association between endometrial_cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast_cancer in a case-control study.
Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial_cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001).
Women who had endometrial_cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced_disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial_cancer who had not received this treatment.
Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial_cancer  particularly when used as currently proposed for breast_cancer prevention.
Endometrial_cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis.
Women who receive tamoxifen for breast_cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment.
Granulosa_cell_tumor_of_the_ovary associated with antecedent tamoxifen use.
Review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumors 
CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast_carcinoma 
A murine model of adenomyosis  the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine_hydrochloride  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on adenomyosis induction in Wistar albino rats.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomyosis 
DESIGN: Fluoxetine  a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactinemia 
Histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomyosis  all within the noncastrated group receiving fluoxetine 
Effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function.
Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group).
Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group, but, although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer.
Cardiotoxic and possible leukemogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates. 10 monkeys (macaques) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg/m2 (1 mg/kg). 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive_heart_failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose (310 mg/m2) well below that considered the safe upper limit (550 mg/m2) in man.
Histologically, the myocardial_lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy  1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute_myeloblastic_leukemia after receiving 324 mg/m2 of adriamycin  the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug.
Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left-sided Wilms_tumor 
Two children with Wilms_tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of doxorubicin 
The cardiomyopathy is attributed 1) to the fact that radiation fields for left Wilms_tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2) to the interaction of doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac muscle.
Promotional effects of testosterone and dietary fat on prostate carcinogenesis in genetically susceptible rats.
Conventional LW rats, implanted with testosterone at age 4 months, developed a higher incidence of prostate_cancer after an average interval of 14 months: 24% had developed gross tumors  and 40% when it included microscopic tumors 
Preliminary results indicate that testosterone treated LW rats that were fed the same diet, which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20% fat, developed prostate_cancer after intervals of 6-12 months.
Conventional SD rats fed diet L-485 and treated with testosterone developed only prostatitis 
Mitomycin_C associated hemolytic_uremic_syndrome 
Mitomycin_C associated Hemolytic_Uremic_Syndrome (HUS  is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised.
It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic_anemia  thrombocytopenia and progressive renal_failure associated with mitomycin_C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent.
The renal_failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin_C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal_failure or pulmonary_edema 
Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac_toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU  therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion.
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes.
Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion).
The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01).
Lethal anuria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast_cancer patient with an impaired_renal_function 
A sixty-year-old woman with advanced breast_cancer  previously treated with cisplatin  developed an irreversible lethal renal_failure with anuria  the day after 5 g/m2 bolus ifosfamide 
Ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubulopathies 
We strongly suspect that this lethal anuria was mainly due to ifosfamide  occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypotension 
Central vein_thrombosis and topical dipivalyl_epinephrine 
Amelioration of bendrofluazide induced hypokalemia by timolol 
The beta adrenergic blocking drug, timolol  tended to correct the hypokalemia of short-term bendrofluazide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in children and adolescents.
RESULTS: Hyperprolactinemia was present in 49% of 83 boys (n = 41) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 years.
Serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactinemia 
Of 13 documented fractures  3 occurred after risperidone and SSRIs were started, and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactinemia 
Seizures associated with levofloxacin  case presentation and literature review.
PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of levofloxacin induced seizures 
RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin induced seizures have been reported in the literature.
Mice lacking mPGES-1 are resistant to lithium induced polyuria 
Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium induced polyuria 
The present study was undertaken to assess lithium induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin_E synthase-1 (mPGES-1).
A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine.
In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output.
Recently, a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated chondroitin_sulfate (OSCS) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response in pigs following a single high-dose infusion.
Using both contaminated heparin products and the synthetically produced derivative, we showed that the OSCS produces dose-dependent hypotension in pigs.
Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B1 receptor.
Clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX  is limited by its cardiotoxic effects, which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis.
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) during the development of DOX cardiomyopathy  we studied B1R knockout mice (B1R(-/-)) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of DOX induced cardiomyopathy 
DOX control mice showed cardiac_dysfunction measured by pressure-volume loops in vivo.
In DOX B1R(-/-) mice, cardiac_dysfunction was improved compared to DOX control mice, which was associated with normalization of the bax/bcl-2 ratio and interleukin 6, as well as AKT activation state.
These findings suggest that B1R is detrimental in DOX cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis.
Hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis  A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events.
Patients', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified.
The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions.
The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients.
An evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology/oncology population.
Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for febrile_neutropenia and other suspected infections 
To evaluate amikacin associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center.
Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy  has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT  neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA induced 5-HT neurotoxic_lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function.
In contrast, no evidence of memory_impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users.
While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered "moderate" is not associated with impaired_memory_functioning  heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory_impairments 
Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental hyperprolactinemia induced by haloperidol 
The aim of the study was to examine the influence of hyperprolactinemia  induced by haloperidol (HAL  on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe.
Does supplemental vitamin_C increase cardiovascular_disease risk in women with diabetes 
These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin_C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis 
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin_C intake and mortality from cardiovascular_disease 
DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin_C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular_disease (n = 281), coronary_artery_disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline.
RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular_disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes  and intakes of folate  vitamin_E  and beta-carotene  the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular_disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin_C intake from food and supplements.
Vitamin_C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular_disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline.
Absolute and attributable risk of venous_thromboembolism in women on combined cyproterone_acetate and ethinylestradiol 
OBJECTIVE: To achieve absolute risk estimates of venous_thromboembolism (VTE  among women on cyproterone_acetate plus ethinylestradiol (CPA EE , and among women on combined_oral_contraceptives (COCs .
RESULTS: During the time frame of the study, 330 women were found to have had VTE while on COCs 
The corresponding absolute risk of VTE was 3.4 (range, 3.1-3.8) per 10 000 women years among the women on COCs  4.2 (range, 3.2-5.2) per 10 000 women years among women on levonorgestrel containing COCs  and 3.1 (range, 1.3-4.9) per 10 000 women years among the women on CPA EE 
Effect of lindane on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in lindane induced neurotoxicity 
Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC , an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions  pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or ethanol  an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions 
Seizure associated with sleep_deprivation and sustained-release bupropion 
This case report describes a generalized seizure associated with sustained-release bupropion use and sleep_deprivation 
After 5 weeks of bupropion use, the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic seizure after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol  with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol 
The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography.
Experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin  a PET study.
A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve.
Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome with risperidone 
Neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia.
The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal_symptoms with risperidone at low dosages.
A 73-year-old woman developed neuroleptic_malignant_syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone 
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic_syndrome (NS .
NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin_amino-nucleoside (PAN .
Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection, when NS was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change.
Cyclophosphamide associated bladder_cancer -a highly aggressive disease: analysis of 12 cases.
PURPOSE: We gained knowledge of the etiology, treatment and prevention of cyclophosphamide associated urothelial_cancer 
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 6 men and 6 women (mean age 55 years) with cyclophosphamide associated bladder_cancer were reviewed.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide associated bladder_tumor is an aggressive disease.
Leg_and_back_pain after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5% lignocaine 
Five of the 13 patients (38%) with pain and seven of the 41 patients (17%) without pain admitted to a high alcohol intake, which might be a contributing factor.
Acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension 
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated.
Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion.
Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives 
Hallucinations and ifosfamide induced neurotoxicity 
BACKGROUND: Hallucinations as a symptom of central neurotoxicity are a known but poorly described side effect of ifosfamide 
Most cases of ifosfamide induced hallucinations have been reported with other mental status changes.
METHODS: The authors interviewed six persons with ifosfamide induced hallucinations in the presence of a clear sensorium.
The clinician should be alerted for possible ifosfamide induced hallucinations  which may occur without other signs of neurotoxicity  "Eyes-closed" hallucinatory experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation.
Chlorpropamide induced optic_neuropathy 
A 65-year-old woman with adult-onset_diabetes treated with chlorpropamide (Diabenese  had a toxic_optic_neuropathy that resolved with discontinuation of chlorpropamide therapy.
Levodopa induced dyskinesia and thalamotomy.
Levodopa induced dyskinesia of the limbs in thirteen cases of Parkinsonism  which was choreic, ballistic or dystonic in type, was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus, but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus.
Factors associated with nephrotoxicity and clinical outcome in patients receiving amikacin 
Data from 60 patients treated with amikacin were analyzed for factors associated with nephrotoxicity

Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged isoflurane induced hypotension in humans.
The effect of isoflurane induced hypotension on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects.
Hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg.
The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline induced hypokalemia 
Cefotetan induced immune hemolytic_anemia 
Immune hemolytic_anemia due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins 
We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan 
Acute_renal_failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin 
The patients had developed transient renal_failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin 
Hepatitis_B immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type_B_hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis_B_surface_antigen (HBsAG -positive donors.
Serotonin_syndrome from venlafaxine tranylcypromine interaction.
Excessive stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors causes a syndrome of serotonin excess that consists of shivering, muscle_rigidity  salivation  confusion  agitation and hyperthermia 
We report a venlafaxine MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin_syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression 
After 180 mg of diazepam i.v. he remained tremulous with muscle_rigidity and clenched jaws.
Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on L-dopa induced dyskinesias in MPTP treated monkeys.
A group of four monkeys was rendered parkinsonian with the toxin MPTP 
A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the dyskinetic movements would be modified.
Several drugs, including clonidine  physostigmine  methysergide  5-MDOT  propranolol  and MK-801  markedly reduced the dyskinetic movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology.
However, yohimbine and meperidine reduced predominantly the dyskinetic movements.
Baclofen was also useful in one monkey against a more dystonic form of dyskinesia 
CCNU (lomustine  toxicity in dogs: a retrospective study (2002-07).
OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of haematological,_renal,_hepatic_and_gastrointestinal_toxicities in tumour-bearing dogs receiving 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU .
RESULTS: Of the 206 dogs treated with CCNU  185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of toxicity 
CCNU was used most commonly in the treatment of lymphoma  mast_cell_tumour  brain_tumour  histiocytic_tumours and epitheliotropic_lymphoma 
Potential renal toxicity and elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) concentration were reported in 12.2% and 48.8% of dogs, respectively.
Neuroactive steroids protect against pilocarpine  and kainic_acid induced limbic seizures and status_epilepticus in mice.
Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3_alpha-hydroxy_pregnane-20-ones  and deoxycorticosterone (3_alpha-hydroxy_pregnane-21-diol-20-ones  and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against pilocarpine , kainic_acid  and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  induced seizures in mice.
Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.) induced limbic motor seizures and status_epilepticus (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.).
Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against pilocarpine seizures  steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam  indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity 
Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by kainic_acid (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures 
However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic_acid induced limbic seizures and status_epilepticus was obtained.
The steroids also caused a dose-dependent delay in NMDA (257 mg/kg, s.c.) induced lethality, but did not completely protect against NMDA seizures or lethality.
The safety and efficacy of combination N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334  and zidovudine in patients with HIV-1_infection and 200-500 CD4 cells/mm3.
The mean SC-48334 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
CB_3717  N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic_acid  is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme.
As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB_3717  respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of CB_3717 cytotoxicity 
In early clinical studies with CB_3717  activity has been seen in breast_cancer  ovarian_cancer  hepatoma  and mesothelioma 
Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic induced parkinsonism 
In a 12-week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine_enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients.
Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian_symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine  their previous antiparkinsonian drug.
However, benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive_dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment, and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients.
Effect of alpha-tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity 
Methamphetamine (MA  induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals.
This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC , a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO , an iron chelator, on the MA induced neurotoxicity 
The concentrations of dopamine (DA , serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity.
Use of dexamethasone with mesna for the prevention of ifosfamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis 
AIM: Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC  is a limiting side-effect of chemotherapy with ifosfamide (IFS .
In the study presented here, we investigated the use of dexamethasone in combination with mesna for the prevention of IFS induced HC 
CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone in combination with mesna was efficient in blocking IFS induced HC 
Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial_dyskinesia  tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive_dyskinesia 
Reserpine also produced tremor and catalepsy  which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's_disease 
MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by reserpine 
However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in reserpine treated mice.
Reserpine (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral_dyskinesia in mice.
On the other hand, reserpine induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice.
MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by reserpine 
Pretreatment with reserpine (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy  whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of reserpine 
These results show that reserpine produces different and abnormal_movements  which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian like and tardive_dsykinesia signs.
Effect of glyceryl_trinitrate on the sphincter of Oddi spasm evoked by prostigmine morphine administration.
OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of glyceryl_trinitrate on the prostigmine morphine induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter_of_Oddi_dyskinesia 
METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine morphine administration (0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
RESULTS: Prostigmine morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi.
CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl_trinitrate on the morphine induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans.
Occasional case reports have shown that acute myopathy may occur in patients treated with massive doses of corticosteroids 
Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction_of_food_intake in the steroid treated groups (-50 and -79% in M and T  respectively).
Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with M  whereas tetanic tensions were similar.
ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber atrophy in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa atrophy with T  whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis 
Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T  and PF), showed that muscle_atrophy was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T treated animals.
(2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb atrophy  resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties.
(3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis 
Refractory cardiogenic_shock and complete heart_block after verapamil SR and metoprolol treatment.
A seventy-eight-year-old woman presented with complete heart_block and refractory hypotension two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained-release verapamil with concomitant use of metoprolol 
The patient continued to remain hypotensive with complete heart_block  even with multiple uses of intravenous atropine as well as high doses of pressor agents such as dopamine and dobutamine 
Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate 
However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities 
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic_acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose.
This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic_acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic_acid supplementation.
There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation.
Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic_acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance.
Intradermal injection of mu, but not delta or kappa opioid-agonists, however, produced dose-dependent inhibition of prostaglandin_E2 induced hyperalgesia 
Morphine did not, however, alter the hyperalgesia induced by 8-bromo_cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate 
Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic_hepatitis_C 
BACKGROUND: Hemolytic_anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin 
Because of ribavirin related hemolytic_anemia  dose reduction is a common event in this therapy.
In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy.
However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia related severe side effects occurred (group B).
Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in puromycin_aminonucleoside induced nephrotic_syndrome in rats.
Nephrotic_syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized edema 
After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria  hypoalbuminemia  decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites 
In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN induced nephrotic_syndrome 
Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole  tamoxifen alone or combined (ATAC) (n=94) and a group of women without breast_cancer (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures.
Association of nitric_oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephropathy 
We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic_syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (ADR .
Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR induced nephropathy groups.
RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial_proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial_inflammation 
Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR nephropathy group (P < 0.05).
In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR nephropathy group.
However, in the ADR nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas.
The attenuating effect of carteolol_hydrochloride  a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic induced catalepsy in rats.
Therefore, the effects of carteolol  a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden  a muscarinic receptor antagonist.
Carteolol  as well as propranolol and biperiden  inhibited the haloperidol induced catalepsy 
Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats.
Penicillamine induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a patient with rheumatoid_arthritis 
A 67-year-old woman with rheumatoid_arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN  after 5 months of D-penicillamine (250 mg/day) treatment.
This new case of RPGN in the course of D-penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patients.

We present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral_palsy and seizure_disorder  receiving clonidine for restlessness  who presented for placement of a baclofen pump.
Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety 
Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the convulsive  lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice.
In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with UMB24 or (+/-)-SM_21 significantly attenuated cocaine induced convulsions and locomotor activity, but not lethality.
Methimazole induced cholestatic_jaundice 
A 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism 
Methimazole induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed.
Ciprofloxacin induced acute interstitial_nephritis and autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia 
Ciprofloxacin has been associated with several side effects including interstitial_nephritis and hemolytic_anemia 
In this report, we describe a case of ciprofloxacin induced interstitial_nephritis and autoimmune_hemolytic_anemia 
Hemolytic_anemia improved after stopping the drug and initiation of steroid therapy.
Contribution of sodium_valproate to the syndrome_of_inappropriate_secretion_of_antidiuretic_hormone 
We report the case of a 62-year-old man who was administered sodium_valproate (VPA  and who subsequently developed the syndrome_of_inappropriate_secretion_of_antidiuretic_hormone (SIADH .
He had been taking VPA for treatment of idiopathic generalized tonic-clonic_convulsions since he was 56 years old.
Vasopressin in the treatment of milrinone induced hypotension in severe heart_failure 
The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart_failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension 
Two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane  have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic_injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane 
Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response.
An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients.
This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane 
Induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat.
Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol treated groups, and three rats bore bladder_carcinomas 
Additionally, 20 to 25% of paracetamol treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder_calculi 
A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding.
In addition to muscle_damage  severe damage was also seen in harderian glands, especially after exposure to mepivacaine and lidocaine plus epinephrine 
Reversal of neuroleptic induced catalepsy by novel aryl-piperazine anxiolytic drugs.
The novel anxiolytic drug, buspirone  reverses catalepsy induced by haloperidol 
A series of aryl-piperazine analogues of buspirone and other 5-hydroxytryptaminergic_agonists were tested for their ability to reverse haloperidol induced catalepsy 
Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy 
Diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rats.
Also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1).
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam  although causing no change in the adrenaline induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline induced reflex bradycardia 
However, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine GABA chloride channel macromolecular complex).
Chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine 
The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ  treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration.
Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine  and cocaine induced seizures  but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures 
Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure related mortality in the cocaine injected rats.
Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine kindled or acute cocaine induced seizures 
Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine  or cocaine kindled seizures 
The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures 
D-penicillamine in the treatment of localized_scleroderma 
Case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive localized_scleroderma who were treated with D-penicillamine are summarized in this article.
D-Penicillamine caused nephrotic_syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal_insufficiency 
Preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs.
The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested.
Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during fenoldopam induced hypotension 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside induced hypotension (P less than 0.01).
Sodium nitroprusside is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension 
Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of cibenzoline on canine ventricular_arrhythmias 
Antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-cibenzoline and (-)-cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular_arrhythmia models.
Digitalis arrhythmia  which is suppressed by Na channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital anesthetized dogs.
Adrenaline_arrhythmia  which is suppressed by Ca channel blockers, was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane anesthetized dogs.
(+)-cibenzoline suppressed digitalis  and adrenaline induced arrhythmias  respectively.
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-cibenzoline for digitalis  and adrenaline induced arrhythmias were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6).
A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis induced arrhythmia  whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress adrenaline induced arrhythmias 
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-cibenzoline for digitalis  and adrenaline induced arrhythmia were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6).
Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus_rosa_sinensis (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on reserpine induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations.
Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic timolol with placebo on the 24-hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for glaucoma 
DESIGN: This trial evaluated the effect of placebo, 0.5% aqueous timolol (timolol solution) and a 0.5% timolol suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva (timolol gellan) on the 24-hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for glaucoma to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate.
METHODS: Forty-three Caucasian patients with primary open-angle_glaucoma or ocular_hypertension with a mean (+/-SD) age of 63 (+/-8) years were randomized and crossed over in a double-masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo (morning and evening in both eyes), timolol solution (morning and evening in both eyes), or timolol gellan (morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening).
5_flourouracil induced apical_ballooning_syndrome  a case report.
She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal_cancer 
Reduction of pain during induction with target-controlled propofol and remifentanil 
BACKGROUND: Pain on injection of propofol is unpleasant.
We hypothesized that propofol infusion pain might be prevented by infusing remifentanil before starting the propofol infusion in a clinical setting where target-controlled infusions (TCI) of both drugs were used.
A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine the effect-site concentration (Ce) of remifentanil to prevent the pain without producing complications.
Remifentanil related complications were assessed during the remifentanil infusion, and pain caused by propofol was evaluated using a four-point scale during the propofol infusion.
Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces fetal pulmonary hypertension in the rat.
Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent pulmonary_hypertension_syndrome of the newborn.
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a pulmonary_hypertension protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents.
As compared with controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in fetal pulmonary hypertension as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01).
Syncope and QT_prolongation among patients treated with methadone for heroin dependence in the city of Copenhagen.
Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with torsade_de_pointes (TdP  has been reported in methadone users.
As heroin addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs, doctors might attribute too many episodes of syncope to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of TdP in this special population, and the high mortality in this population may, in part, be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of methadone 
The association between opioid dose and QT, and methadone dose and reporting of syncope was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression, respectively.
Among the subjects treated with methadone  28% men and 32% women had prolonged_QTc_interval 
A 50 mg higher methadone dose was associated with a 1.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.4) times higher odds for syncope 
Peripheral_neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine_arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute_myeloid_leukemia 
The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine_arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine_arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported.
The first course of high-dose cytosine_arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot.
This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host_disease  and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone 
Atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone induced hypertension in the rat.
To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva  on dexamethasone (dex  induced hypertension  60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days.
Atorva reversed dex induced hypertension (129 +/- 0.6 mmHg, vs. 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg P' < 0.05) and decreased plasma superoxide (7931 +/- 392.8 dex  1187 +/- 441.2 atorva + dex  P < 0.0001).
Two prodrugs of potent and selective GluR5 kainate receptor antagonists actives in three animal models of pain 
Erythropoietin restores the anemia induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors 
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors 
Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration.
In a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application.
Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum.
Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se.
When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed.
The role of nitrergic system in lidocaine induced convulsion in the mouse.
The effects of N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl_ester (L-NAME  a nitric_oxide (NO  synthase inhibitor and L-arginine  a NO precursor, were investigated on lidocaine induced convulsions 
L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the incidence of lidocaine (50 mg/kg) induced convulsions 
In contrast, the L-arginine treatment increased the incidence of lidocaine (80 mg/kg, i.p.) induced convulsions significantly.
Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine induced myocardial_ischemia 
Prednisolone induced muscle_dysfunction is caused more by atrophy than by altered acetylcholine receptor expression.
On Day 8, the nerve-evoked peak twitch tensions, tetanic tensions, and fatigability, and the dose-response curves of d-tubocurarine in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs.
Our results suggest that the neuromuscular_dysfunction after prednisolone is dose-dependent, and derives primarily from muscle_atrophy and derives less so from changes in AChR expression.
Rapid reversal of life-threatening diltiazem induced tetany with calcium_chloride 
We describe a patient who developed tetany with sudden respiratory_arrest after the infusion of intravenous diltiazem 
The administration of calcium_chloride rapidly resolved the patient's tetany with prompt recovery of respiratory function, averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support.
Patients with aneurysmal_subarachnoid_hemorrhage (SAH  were randomized to receive either ketoprofen  100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen  1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH 
Maximal platelet_aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine_diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen 
In contrast, maximal platelet_aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet_aggregation results (P < .05).
One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma 
Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH 
Value of methylprednisolone in prevention of the arthralgia myalgia syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of iron_dextran  a double blind randomized trial.
These data demonstrate that administration of MP before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the arthralgia myalgia syndrome.
Forty patients with Non-Hodgkin's_Lymphoma treated with vincristine between 1984 and 1990 (cumulative dose 12 mg in 18-24 weeks) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of vincristine on the peripheral nervous system.
A case of polymyositis in a patient with primary_biliary_cirrhosis treated with D-penicillamine 
Although D-penicillamine has been used for many rheumatologic_diseases  toxicity limits its usefulness in many patients.
Polymyositis dermatomyositis can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of D-penicillamine treatment, but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear.
We report a patient with primary_biliary_cirrhosis  who developed polymyositis while receiving D-penicillamine therapy.
Photodistributed nifedipine induced facial telangiectasia 
Five months after starting nifedipine (Adalat , two patients developed photodistributed facial telangiectasia  which became more noticeable with time.
One commenced the closely related drug amlodipine 3 years later, with recurrence of telangiectasia 
Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin_A and FK506  inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase.
Cyclosporin_A (CsA  50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506  5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days.
The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated.
Massive cerebral_edema associated with fulminant hepatic_failure in acetaminophen overdose  possible role of cranial decompression.
Gentamicin nephropathy in a neonate.
The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of acute_renal_failure after therapy with gentamicin (5 mg/kg/day) and penicillin are presented.
The serum gentamicin concentration had reached toxic levels when anuria developed.
Anti-carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat.
The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital (PB  15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN  10 mg/kg/day).
Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis 
After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic_foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks.
In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone.
It is concluded that PB  which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN 
Post-operative rigidity after fentanyl administration.
A case of thoraco-abdominal rigidity leading to respiratory_failure is described in the post-operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of fentanyl 
Postpartum psychosis induced by bromocriptine 
Two multigravida patients with no prior psychiatric history were seen with postpartum psychosis  having received bromocriptine for inhibition_of_lactation 
Bromocriptine given in high doses has been associated with psychosis in patients receiving the drug for Parkinson's_disease 
A prospective study on the dose dependency of cardiotoxicity induced by mitomycin_C 
Since 1975 mitomycin_C (MMC  has been suggested to be cardiotoxic  especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin 
One of the patients developed cardiac_failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin 
Phlorizin induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats.
Because rats with streptozotocin induced diabetes_mellitus (DM  have a high solute diuresis (glycosuria of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin induced acute_renal_failure (ARF .
The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (P .
DM rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the P treated animals) were also studied.
Group 1 (P alone) received P  360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (P + gentamicin ; Group III (gentamicin alone) and Group IV (mild DM + gentamicin .
Nephrotoxic doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV.
In Group I, P induced a moderate and stable glycosuria (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal_dysfunction (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (tubular_necrosis score [maximum 4], zero).
In Group II, P did not prevent gentamicin ARF (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, P less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and tubular_necrosis score, 3.9 +/- 0.1).
Tiapride in levodopa induced involuntary_movements 
Tiapride  a substituted benzamide derivative closely related to metoclopramide  reduced levodopa induced peak dose involuntary_movements in 16 patients with idiopathic_Parkinson's_disease 
Tiapride had no effect on levodopa induced early morning of "off-period" segmental dystonia 
Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats.
The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin induced epilepsy model.
RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity.
Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.
The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA  receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia 
Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia 
In patients with schizophrenia  ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic_dysfunction 
Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology.
Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia  particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions.
Dopamine is not essential for the development of methamphetamine induced neurotoxicity 
It is widely believed that dopamine (DA  mediates methamphetamine (METH  induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons, because drugs that interfere with DA neurotransmission decrease toxicity  whereas drugs that increase DA neurotransmission enhance toxicity 
Here we show that the recently reported ability of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine on METH induced DA neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature.
Further, we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain DA develop METH neurotoxicity  as long as the thermic effects of METH are preserved.
In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH induced dopaminergic_deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain.
Brainstem_dysgenesis in an infant prenatally exposed to cocaine 
The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin induced diabetic_nephropathy 
OBJECTIVE: Diabetic_nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal_failure  which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic_nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic_nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin induced diabetic_nephropathy model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells.
In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin induced renal_damage 
High-dose tranexamic_Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients.
The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery.
All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures.
Recurrent dysosmia induced by pyrazinamide 
Pyrazinamide can have adverse effects such as hepatic_toxicity  hyperuricemia or digestive disorders.
We report a case of reversible olfactory_disorder related to pyrazinamide in a woman, with a positive rechallenge.
Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and sulindac for prevention of sporadic colorectal_adenomas 
A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous_polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO  plus sulindac or matched placebos.
Temporary hearing_loss is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO  thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms.
There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing_loss compared with the placebo group.
Increased mental_slowing associated with the APOE epsilon4 allele after trihexyphenidyl oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon4 and subjective effects of trihexyphenidyl on measures reflecting sedation and confusion and to investigate the relationship between trihexyphenidyl induced subjective effects and objective memory performance.
RESULTS: A 2.0-mg oral dose of trihexyphenidyl resulted in increased subjective ratings of mental_slowness in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only.
Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2.0 mg trihexyphenidyl and placebo on ratings of mental_slowness significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele only.
Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression 
T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability  or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression 
Intracavitary chemotherapy (paclitaxel carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases) for recurrent glioblastoma -- clinical observations.
For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study.
A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of paclitaxel and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages.
Six of the patients received more than 15 mg paclitaxel and suffered from moderate to severe brain_edema  while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg paclitaxel 
Methylphenidate induced obsessive-compulsive_symptoms in an elderly man.
An 82-year-old man with treatment-resistant_depression and early Alzheimer's_disease was started on methylphenidate 
Significant obsessive-compulsive_behavior ensued but diminished over several weeks when methylphenidate was replaced by fluvoxamine 
Cardiac_arrest after intravenous metoclopramide - a case of five repeated injections of metoclopramide causing five episodes of cardiac_arrest 
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of metoclopramide was immediately followed by asystole repeatedly.
After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation, it is clear that every administration of metoclopramide was immediately (within s) followed by asystole 
We interpret this as episodes of cardiac_arrest caused by metoclopramide 
Severe immune hemolytic_anemia associated with prophylactic use of cefotetan in obstetric and gynecologic procedures.
Second- and third-generation cephalosporins  especially cefotetan  are increasingly associated with severe, sometimes fatal immune hemolytic_anemia 
We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of cefotetan induced hemolytic_anemias were in patients who had received cefotetan prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures.
Cauda_equina_syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine  a review of six cases of cauda_equina_syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997.
Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine 
Cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with L-dopa induced peak-dose dyskinesia 
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L-dopa medication, the first one without L-dopa induced dyskinesia (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose dyskinesia (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects.
Dexamethasone induced ocular_hypertension in perfusion-cultured human eyes.
In contrast, the dexamethasone treated hypertensive_eyes had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm.
CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular_hypertension in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone treated eyes.
Steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid_glaucoma and open_angle_glaucoma 
Cognitive_deterioration from long-term abuse of dextromethorphan  a case report.
Complete heart_block following a single dose of trazodone 
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of trazodone  a patient developed complete heart_block 
Quinidine_phenylethylbarbiturate induced fulminant hepatitis in a pregnant woman.
We report the case of a 19-year-old Laotian patient affected by fulminant hepatitis during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1-month administration of quinidine_phenylethylbarbiturate 
The epidemiology of the acute flank_pain syndrome from suprofen 
Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay_fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5).
Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen , preexisting renal_disease  a history of kidney_stones  a history of gout  a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt.
Hemolytic-uremic_syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine 
Hemolytic-uremic_syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature.
Quinine associated hemolytic-uremic_syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized.
The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of heparin therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation.
Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha-benzene_hexachloride 
Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver_lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene_hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically.
Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes.
Quinidine hepatitis 
We concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation.
In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl_hemisuccinate  tris_salt (CS  administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon_tetrachloride (CCl4 .
To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS  gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric_acid  tris_salt (CSE  against acetaminophen , adriamycin , carbon_tetrachloride , chloroform  and galactosamine induced toxicity 
A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4  CHCl3  acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic  effect of adriamycin administration.
The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity .
DSMM XI study: dose definition for intravenous cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib dexamethasone for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma 
A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple_myeloma (MM .
Results of a comparative, phase III, 12-week, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of telmisartan and amlodipine versus amlodipine monotherapy in Indian adults with stage II hypertension 
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) of telmisartan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg (T+A) compared with amlodipine 5-mg monotherapy (A) in adult Indian patients with stage II hypertension 
Cutaneous_leucocytoclastic_vasculitis associated with oxacillin 
A 67-year-old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia  developed renal_failure and diffuse, symmetric, palpable purpuric_lesions on his feet.
Pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia  catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes.
Moreover, naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine induced hypotension and respiratory_depression  whereas morphine induced bradycardia was less affected.
Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin 
PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac_toxicity limit their use.
Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187  is recommended for protection against anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic_toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide  daunorubicin  and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays.
RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight_loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression  weight_loss  nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin 
Effects of the novel compound aniracetam (Ro_13-5057  upon impaired learning and memory in rodents.
The effect of aniracetam (Ro_13-5057  1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone  was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired_cognitive_functions (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session.
(2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the scopolamine induced short-term amnesia for a passive avoidance task.
These improvements or normalizations of impaired_cognitive_functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg/kg.
Nicotine potentiation of morphine induced catalepsy in mice.
In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated.
Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy 
Intraperitoneal administration of atropine  naloxone  mecamylamine  and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine 
Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine  hexamethonium  and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine 
Reduced cardiotoxicity and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide compared with conventional doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic breast_cancer 
PURPOSE: To determine whether Myocet (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin  The Liposome Company, Elan Corporation, Princeton, NJ) in combination with cyclophosphamide significantly reduces doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic breast_cancer (MBC .
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg/m(2) of Myocet (M) or conventional doxorubicin (A), in combination with 600 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide (C), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity 
Protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN_52021  on bupivacaine induced cardiovascular_impairments in rats.
Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively).
Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist BN_52021 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR.
When BN_52021 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective.
Since the administration of BN_52021  at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN_52021  a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine induced cardiovascular_toxicity 
Benzylacyclouridine reverses azidothymidine induced marrow_suppression without impairment of anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity.
Increased extracellular concentrations of uridine (Urd  have been reported to reduce, in vitro, azidothymidine (AZT  induced inhibition of human granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity.
Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration, the ability of benzylacyclouridine (BAU  to effect, in vivo, AZT induced anemia and leukopenia was assessed.
This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose-dependent manner, without Urd related toxicity 
In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg/mL), the continued administration of AZT plus daily BAU (300 mg/kg, orally) partially reversed AZT induced anemia and leukopenia (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved megaloblastosis 
When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration, BAU reduced AZT induced marrow_toxicity 
Cyclophosphamide induced cystitis in freely-moving conscious rats: behavioral approach to a new model of visceral_pain 
Cyclophosphamide (CP , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein  was used to induce cystitis 
Morphine dose-dependently reversed these behavioral_disorders 
At the time of administration of morphine  histological modifications of the bladder wall, such as chorionic and muscle layer edema  were observed.
Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine 
Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia 
Vancomycin was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection 
Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus vancomycin 
Blockade of both D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors may induce catalepsy in mice. 1.
The catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists has been tested and the possible dopamine subtypes involved in catalepsy was determined. 2.
Dopamine antagonist fluphenazine  D-1 antagonist SCH_23390 or D-2 antagonist sulpiride induced catalepsy 
Combination of SCH_23390 with sulpiride did not induce catalepsy potentiation. 3.
D-1 agonist SKF_38393 or D-2 agonist quinpirole decreased the catalepsy induced by fluphenazine  SCH_23390 or sulpiride  4.
Combination of SKF_38393 with quinpirole did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on catalepsy induced by dopamine antagonists. 5.
Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using acetic_acid induced writhing model (mice) and carrageenan induced rat paw edema model, respectively.
The 47-year-old female patient, known to have hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy  was admitted with biventricular_failure and managed aggressively with dobutamine infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation.
It is likely that the hypersensitivity (eosinophilic  myocarditis was related to dobutamine infusion therapy.
All-_trans-retinoic_acid induced erythema_nodosum in patients with acute_promyelocytic_leukemia 
Erythema_nodosum associated with all-_trans-retinoic_acid (ATRA  for acute_promyelocytic_leukemia (APL  is very rare.
We describe four patients with classic APL who developed erythema_nodosum during ATRA therapy.
Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous_nodules over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after ATRA therapy.
ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema_nodosum in our patients.
Delayed-onset heparin induced thrombocytopenia 
BACKGROUND: Heparin induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli.
Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin induced thrombocytopenia are delayed.
PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications.
MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism  results of heparin induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset heparin induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized.
Valsartan  a new angiotensin_II antagonist for the treatment of essential hypertension  a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against amlodipine 
METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly allocated in double-blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg valsartan or 5 mg amlodipine for 12 weeks.
The incidence of drug-related dependent edema was somewhat higher in the amlodipine group, particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day (2.4% for 80 mg valsartan  3.6% for 5 mg amlodipine  0% for valsartan plus 5 mg amlodipine  14.3% for 10 mg amlodipine .
CONCLUSIONS: The data show that valsartan is at least as effective as amlodipine in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension 
Oral administration of KF17837 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine A2A receptor agonist, CGS_21680 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner.
KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.).
A repeated treatment with fluvoxamine (twice daily for 14 days) potentiated in mice and in rats (weaker) the amphetamine induced hyperactivity 
The hyperactivity induced by nomifensine in mice remained unaffected by fluvoxamine 
Severe congestive_heart_failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma  a case report.
This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive_heart_failure (CHF .
To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy.
Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism  and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.
This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients.
Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-(PR3-ANCA) positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment.
A 59-year-old woman with ulcerative_colitis developed red_eyes  pleural_effusion  eosinophilia and urinary_abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment.
Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever  red_eyes  chest_pain  titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the pleural_effusions  we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the pleural_effusion remained.
One month after steroid therapy, the pleural_effusion disappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later.
Is phenytoin administration safe in a hypothermic child.
Intravenous phenytoin was administered during the later part of the surgery for seizure prophylaxis.
Following phenytoin administration, the patient developed acute severe bradycardia  refractory to atropine and adrenaline 
The cardiac depressant actions of phenytoin and hypothermia can be additive.
Administration of phenytoin in the presence of hypothermia may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children.
Amisulpride related tic-like_symptoms in an adolescent schizophrenic 
Tic_disorders can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone  olanzapine and ziprasidone 
However, there are two case reports that show tic-like_symptoms  including motor and phonic variants, occurring during treatment with quetiapine or clozapine 
We present a 15-year-old girl schizophrenic who developed frequent involuntary_eye-blinking_movements after 5 months of amisulpride treatment (1000 mg per day).
The tic-like_symptoms resolved completely after we reduced the dose of amisulpride down to 800 mg per day.
Aspirin (acetylsalicylic_acid [ASA ), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental_anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11.
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal_toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.
RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular_septal_defects (VSDs  and midline_defects (MDs  in rats and diaphragmatic_hernia (DH , MDs  and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations  even though ASA induces several other low-incidence malformations 
Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17).
Torsade_de_pointes induced by metoclopramide in an elderly woman with preexisting complete left_bundle_branch_block 
We report on a 92-year-old woman with preexisting complete left_bundle_branch_block who developed torsade_de_pointes after intravenous and oral administration of metoclopramide 
This patient also developed torsade_de_pointes when cisapride and erythromycin were given simultaneously.
This is the first documentation that metoclopramide provokes torsade_de_pointes clinically.
Apomorphine  an underutilized therapy for Parkinson's_disease 
Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's_disease 
While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's_disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study.
In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa induced dyskinesias 
The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role.
Fatal excited delirium following cocaine use: epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of cocaine toxicity 
We describe an outbreak of deaths from cocaine induced excited delirium (EDDs  in Dade County, Florida between 1979 and 1990.
From a registry of all cocaine related deaths in Dade County, Florida, from 1969-1990, 58 EDDs were compared with 125 victims of accidental cocaine overdose without excited delirium 
EDDs had concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls.
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia  thrombosis  and hemorrhage 
Sixty-two patients with a heparin induced thrombocytopenia are reported.
Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or, more frequently, thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin 
Laboratory testing has revealed a_falling_platelet_count  increased resistance to heparin  and aggregation of platelets by the patient's plasma when heparin is added.
If the platelet count falls to less than 100,000/mm3, while the patient is receiving heparin  platelet_aggregation testing, using the patient's plasma, is indicated.
Cardiac_toxicity of 5-fluorouracil 
We report a case of a patient with colon_carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest_pain after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU  administration.
Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's_angina  and chest_pain promptly resolved with nifedipine 
A strong association has been found between nephritis and dermatitis due to Tiopronin (a D-Penicillamine like compound) and class I antigens B35-Cw4, and between dermatitis due to gold thiosulphate and B35.
Transient hemiparesis  a rare manifestation of diphenylhydantoin toxicity 
Among the common side effects of diphenylhydantoin (DPH  overdose  the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of cerebellar_dysfunction 
Two patients are presented who suffered progressive hemiparesis due to DPH overdose 
Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive_bladder 
We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB 
In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG  and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined.
RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls (p <0.05).
However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB 
In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05).
Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB 
CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients.
Acute low_back_pain during intravenous administration of amiodarone  a report of two cases.
Amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial_fibrillation (AF  and maintenance of sinus rhythm.
Postoperative_myalgia after succinylcholine  no evidence for an inflammatory origin.
A common side effect associated with succinylcholine is postoperative_myalgia 
The incidence and severity of succinylcholine associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succinylcholine (n = 32 for each).
Incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant).
In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succinylcholine associated myalgia 
IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before succinylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succinylcholine induced postoperative_myalgia 
Levodopa induced oromandibular dystonia in progressive_supranuclear_palsy 
Levodopa induced dyskinesias have been reported in Parkinson's_disease and multiple_system_atrophy 
Protective effect of edaravone against streptomycin induced vestibulotoxicity in the guinea pig.
This study investigated alleviation of streptomycin induced vestibulotoxicity by edaravone in guinea pigs.
Edaravone  a free radical scavenger, has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat cerebral_infarction 
Diazepam  unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations 
Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-amnesic effects of pregnenolone_sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats.
Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the amnesic like effects of NMDAR and GABA A)R ligands.
The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine induced amnesia 
Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine induced amnesia 
BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation.
The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin evoked mechanical hypersensitivity 
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical_hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined.
RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical_hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity  presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection.
These were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid_disease .
PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar_disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration.
All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid_illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of lithium therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of lithium therapy).
Systemic toxicity following administration of sirolimus (formerly rapamycin  for psoriasis  association of capillary_leak_syndrome with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes.
After 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary_leak_syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis.
OBSERVATIONS: A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus induced capillary_leak_syndrome had a 2.3-fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells (to 48%) compared with an unaffected sirolimus treated patient with psoriasis (21%).
Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of sirolimus 
CONCLUSIONS: Severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever  anemia  and capillary_leak_syndrome 
Muscle_rigidity was induced by haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 5,7-dichlorokynurenic_acid (5,7-DCKA , a selective glycine site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the haloperidol induced muscle_rigidity (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). 5,7-DCKA injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg/0.5 microl into the intermediate-caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle tone.
Efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin in 3390 women with moderate hypercholesterolemia 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lovastatin in women with moderate hypercholesterolemia 
Myopathy  defined as muscle symptoms with creatine kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal, was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of lovastatin (80 mg).
The effects of REM_sleep_deprivation (REMD  on apomorphine induced aggressiveness and quipazine induced head_twitches in rats were determined.
The incidence of parkinsonism was higher at higher doses of haloperidol and in younger patients.
Akathisia was controlled by the benzodiazepine lorazepam in 14 out of 16 patients, while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective.
Hepatic_veno-occlusive_disease caused by 6-thioguanine 
Clinically reversible veno-occlusive_disease_of_the_liver developed in a 23-year-old man with acute_lymphocytic_leukemia after 10 months of maintenance therapy with 6-thioguanine 
Treatment of ifosfamide induced urothelial_toxicity by oral administration of sodium_2-mercaptoethane_sulphonate (MESNA  to patients with inoperable lung_cancer 
The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound sodium_2-mercaptoethane_sulphonate (MESNA  against urothelial_toxicity induced by ifosfamide (IF  was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung_cancer under treatment with IF (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle.
There were no appreciable differences between the MESNA series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment.
Production of autochthonous prostate_cancer in Lobund-Wistar rats by treatments with N-nitroso-N-methylurea and testosterone 
More than 50% of Lobund-Wistar (L-W) strain rats developed large, palpable prostate_adenocarcinomas (PAs  following treatments with N-nitroso-N-methylurea (CAS: 684-93-5) and testosterone_propionate [(TP  CAS: 57-85-2], and most of the tumor bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions.
Within the same timeframe, no L-W rat developed a similar palpable PA when treated only with TP 
A dystonia like syndrome after neuropeptide (MSH ACTH  stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus.
Dexmedetomidine  acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate induced muscle_rigidity in the rat.
The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (D-MED  is capable of inducing muscle_flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs.
In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle_rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat.
In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil induced muscle_rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion.
Seizure activity with imipenem therapy: incidence and risk factors.
Two elderly patients with a history of either cerebral_vascular_accident (CVA  or head_trauma and no evidence of renal_disease developed seizures while receiving maximum doses of imipenem/cilastatin 
All seizures were controlled with therapeutic doses of phenytoin 
The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by streptozotocin induced diabetes_mellitus  1.
The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in streptozotocin diabetic rats were investigated. 2.
Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation, ATP  and bethanechol  4.
Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation, ATP  and bethanechol  6.
Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded.
The extent of neuronal_injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining.
Amiodarone pulmonary_toxicity 
Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side-effects, the most problematic being pneumonitis 
The pulmonary_toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell-mediated hypersensitivity pneumonitis 
The clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone induced pulmonary_toxicity are characteristic but nonspecific.
Light chain proteinuria and cellular mediated immunity in rifampin treated patients with tuberculosis 
Light chain proteinuria was found in 9 of 17 tuberculosis patients treated with rifampin 
Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension  the influence of dietary sodium restriction.
To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment.
In this study we postulated that during acute_renal_failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels.
Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension  particularly when given as a bolus.
Oxytocin induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood_loss 
Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output.
Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout (VIP-/-) mice with cyclophosphamide (CYP  induced cystitis 
VIP(-/-) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide (CYP  induced cystitis 
A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type (WT) and VIP(-/-) mice with or without CYP induced cystitis (150 mg/kg; i.p.; 48 h).
The data suggest that in VIP(-/-) mice with bladder_inflammation  inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with CYP 
Intraocular pressure in patients with uveitis treated with fluocinolone_acetonide implants.
OBJECTIVE: To report the incidence and management of elevated_intraocular_pressure (IOP) in patients with uveitis treated with the fluocinolone_acetonide (FA  intravitreal implant.
Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa induced dyskinesias 
Case report: Dexatrim (Phenylpropanolamine  as a cause of myocardial_infarction 
Several reports have linked the abuse of PPA with myocardial_injury  especially when overdose is involved.
We report here the first case of Dexatrim (PPA  induced myocardial_injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control.
In addition, we review the 7 other cases of PPA related myocardial_injury that have been reported so far.
Risperidone associated, benign transient visual_disturbances in schizophrenic patients with a past history of LSD abuse.
Two schizophrenic patients, who had a prior history of LSD abuse and who had previously developed EPS with classic antipsychotics, were successfully treated with risperidone 
They both reported short episodes of transient visual_disturbances  which appeared immediately after starting treatment with risperidone 
This imagery resembled visual_disturbances previously experienced as "flashbacks" related to prior LSD consumption.
Risperidone administration was continued and the visual_disturbances gradually wore off.
Activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin induced heart_failure 
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX , a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibiotic.
Thus, we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the DOX induced cardiotoxicity 
Using a dual approach of PARP-1 suppression, by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor PJ34  we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of cardiac_dysfunction induced by DOX 
Treatment with a PJ34 significantly improved cardiac_dysfunction and increased the survival of the animals.
Thus, PARP activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of DOX 
Fluconazole induced torsade_de_pointes 
OBJECTIVE: To present a case of fluconazole associated torsade_de_pointes (TDP  and discuss fluconazole s role in causing TDP 
CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP  including coronary_artery_disease  cardiomyopathy  congestive_heart_failure  and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP 
The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have premature_ventricular_contractions and nonsustained ventricular_tachycardia (NSVT  until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP 
The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents.
In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT_prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature_ventricular_contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole  even at low doses, may cause prolongation_of_the_QT_interval  leading to TDP 
High-dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal_cord_injury 
Because of the National Acute Spinal_Cord_Injury Studies (NASCIS), high-dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal_cord_injury 
In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause.
Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy  instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal_cord_injury 
OUTCOME MEASURES: Pupil size at time points after administration of tropicamide and pilocarpine  scopolamine induced impairment_in_word_recall 
Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine induced impairment_in_word_recall 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05).
Acetazolamide induced Gerstmann_syndrome 
Acute confusion induced by acetazolamide is a well known adverse drug reaction in patients with renal_impairment 
Hypomania like syndrome induced by olanzapine 
Neutrophil superoxide and hydrogen_peroxide production in patients with acute_liver_failure 
Defects in superoxide and hydrogen_peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial_infections in patients with acute_liver_failure (ALF .
In the present study, oxygen radical production in patients with ALF due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers.
Superoxide and hydrogen_peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01).
Superoxide and hydrogen_peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP  from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils.
Absence of effect of sertraline on time-based sensitization of cognitive_impairment with haloperidol 
RESULTS: Impairment_of_cognitive_function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing.
Ciprofloxacin induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer 
Nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is uncommon.
Five patients with cancer who developed acute_renal_failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed.
Case report: pentamidine and polymorphic ventricular_tachycardia revisited.
Pentamidine_isethionate has been associated with ventricular_tachyarrhythmias  including torsade_de_pointes 
Pentamidine induced torsade_de_pointes may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypomagnesemia may synergistically induce torsade.
Torsade_de_pointes occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pentamidine 
Torsade_de_pointes can be treated when recognized early, possibly without discontinuation of pentamidine 
Time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde  oxypurines  and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral_ischemia in the rat.
During ischemia  a time-dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed.
Plasma malondialdehyde  which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia  resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078).
Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia  the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia  although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher.
Cholinergic toxicity resulting from ocular instillation of echothiophate_iodide eye drops.
Acute_renal_failure in high dose carboplatin chemotherapy.
Carboplatin has been reported to cause acute_renal_failure when administered in high doses to adult patients.
We report a 4 1/2-year-old girl who was treated with high-dose carboplatin for metastatic parameningeal embryonal_rhabdomyosarcoma 
She had ovarian_failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for Hodgkin_disease  and received exogenous estrogens  a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial_cancer in menopausal women.
Induction of the obstructive_sleep_apnea_syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration.
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome_of_obstructive_sleep_apnea while being administered exogenous androgens 
A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive_sleep_apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone.
Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep_apnea 
Effect of captopril on pre-existing and aminonucleoside induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients.
The possibility of reproducing the same renal_abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR.
Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR.
Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin_aminonucleoside in SHR.
In one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures 
Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure free.
Reversible cerebral_lesions associated with tiazofurin usage: MR demonstration.
Enhanced stimulus induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation.
Even after early detection and prompt treatment, 41% of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and mydriatics.
We used chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chorioretinopathy attributable to these drugs.
Systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found.
Water_intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline induced abortion 
Four cases of water_intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline induced abortions are described.
Oxytocin administration during midtrimester induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water_intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia  muscular irritability  or headaches

## [Ch 6: Neural Networks](06_Neural_Networks#ch-6-neural-networks)

Neural Networks are very important in machine learning and growing in popularity due to the major breakthroughs in prior unsolved problems.  We must start with introducing 'shallow' neural networks, which are very powerful and can help us improve our prior ML algorithm results.  We start by introducing the very basic NN unit, the operational gate.  We gradually add more and more to the neural network and end with training a model to play tic-tac-toe.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a way of processing textual information into numerical summaries, features, or models. In this chapter we will motivate and explain how to best deal with text in TensorFlow.  We show how to implement the classic 'Bag-of-Words' and show that there may be better ways to embed text based on the problem at hand. There are neural network embeddings called Word2Vec (CBOW and Skip-Gram) and Doc2Vec.  We show how to implement all of these in TensorFlow.

## [Ch 8: Convolutional Neural Networks](08_Convolutional_Neural_Networks#ch-8-convolutional-neural-networks)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are ways of getting neural networks to deal with image data. CNN derive their name from the use of a convolutional layer that applies a fixed size filter across a larger image, recognizing a pattern in any part of the image. There are many other tools that they use (max-pooling, dropout, etc...) that we show how to implement with TensorFlow.  We also show how to retrain an existing architecture and take CNNs further with Stylenet and Deep Dream.

## [Ch 9: Recurrent Neural Networks](09_Recurrent_Neural_Networks#ch-9-recurrent-neural-networks)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are very similar to regular neural networks except that they allow 'recurrent' connections, or loops that depend on the prior states of the network. This allows RNNs to efficiently deal with sequential data, whereas other types of networks cannot. We then motivate the usage of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks as a way of addressing regular RNN problems. Then we show how easy it is to implement these RNN types in TensorFlow.

 1. [Introduction](09_Recurrent_Neural_Networks/01_Introduction#introduction-to-rnns-in-tensorflow)
